### Identified Gaps
1. **Claims Missing Evidence**:  
   Several claims across various studies are identified as lacking sufficient evidence, including:
   - **Authors**: Alexander Romanishyn, Olena Malytska, V. A. Goncharuk  
     **Year**: 2025  
     **Key Point**: Role of AI in information distortion and policy recommendations for democratic resilience.
   - **Authors**: Mahmoud Mohammadi, Yipeng Li, Jane Lo, Wendy Yip  
     **Key Point**: Importance of evaluating LLM agents and proposing new evaluation criteria.
   - **Authors**: Chao Xu, Sung Eui Cho  
     **Key Point**: Analysis of factors affecting collaborative outcomes of AI in the financial sector.
   - **Authors**: Wenyu Jiang, Fuwen Hu  
     **Key Point**: Proposed methodology for predictive maintenance using AI agents.

These gaps underline the necessity for further research and evidence collection to strengthen the validity of the claims.
