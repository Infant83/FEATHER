Abstract
The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI ap-
plications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and un-
derdeveloped area. This survey provides an in-depth overview of
the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-
dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1) eval-
uation objectives—what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capa-
bilities, reliability, and safety—and (2) evaluation process—how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks,
metric computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy,
we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based ac-
cess to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-
horizon interactions, and compliance, which are often overlooked
in current research. We also identify the future research directions,
including holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation. This work
aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of agent evalua-
tion and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world
deployment.

Introduction
Agents based on LLMs are autonomous or semi-autonomous sys-
tems that use LLMs to reason, plan, and act, and represent a rapidly
growing frontier in artificial intelligence [69, 105]. From customer
service bots and coding copilots to digital assistants, LLM agents
are redefining how we build intelligent systems.
As these agents move from research prototypes to real-world
applications [23, 62], the question of how to rigorously evaluate
them becomes both pressing and complex. However, evaluating
LLM agents is more complex than evaluating LLMs in isolation.
Unlike LLMs, which are primarily assessed for text generation or
question answering, LLM agents operate in dynamic, interactive
environments. They reason and make plans, execute tools, lever-
age memory, and even collaborate with humans or other agents
[20]. This complex behavior and dependence on real-world effects
make standard LLM evaluation approaches insufficient. To make an
analogy, LLM evaluation is like examining the performance of an
engine. In contrast, agent evaluation assesses a car’s performance
comprehensively, as well as under various driving conditions.
LLM agent evaluation also differs from traditional software eval-
uation. While software testing focuses on deterministic and static
behavior, LLM agents are inherently probabilistic and behave dy-
namically; therefore, they require new approaches to assessing their
performance. The evaluation of LLM agents is at the intersection
of natural language processing (NLP), human-computer interac-
tion (HCI), and software engineering, which demands additional
perspectives.
Despite increasing interest in this space, existing surveys focus
narrowly on LLM evaluation or cover specific agent capabilities
without a holistic perspective [121]. In addition, enterprise appli-
cations bring additional requirements to agents, including secure
access to data and systems, a high degree of reliability for audit
and compliance purposes, and more complex interaction patterns,
which are rarely addressed in the existing literature [107]. This
survey aims to serve as a helpful reference for practitioners and
researchers in the field of agent evaluation. Our contributions in
this survey are twofold.
• We propose a taxonomy of LLM agent evaluation that orga-
nizes prior work by evaluation objectives (what to evaluate,
such as behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety) and
evaluation process (how to evaluate, including interaction
modes, datasets and benchmarks, metrics computation meth-
ods, evaluation tooling, and evaluation environments).

• We highlight enterprise-specific challenges, including role-
based access control, reliability guarantees, long-term inter-
action, and compliance requirements.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes the taxonomy used in this survey paper to analyze the
agent evaluation landscape. Section 3 dives into the first dimension
of the taxonomy, evaluation objectives, and focuses on the aspects
of the agent to be evaluated. Section 4 describes the second dimen-
sion, the evaluation process, and focuses on the evaluation method.
Section 5 discusses the challenges of assessing LLM agents in enter-
prise environments. Section 6 outlines open questions and future
research directions to guide the next phase of work in evaluating
LLM agents.

Taxonomy for LLM-based Agent Evaluation
We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy to organize different as-
pects of the evaluation of LLM-based agents, structured along the
axes of Evaluation Objectives (what to evaluate) and Evalua-
tion Process (how to evaluate). This taxonomy is visualized as a
hierarchical tree in 1.
The Evaluation Objectives dimension is concerned with the tar-
gets of evaluation. The first category, Agent Behavior, in this dimen-
sion focuses on outcome-oriented aspects such as task completion
and output quality, capturing how well an agent meets end-users’
expectations. Next, Agent Capabilities emphasize process-oriented
competencies, including tool use, planning and reasoning, mem-
ory and context retention, and multi-agent collaboration. These
capabilities provide insights into how agents achieve their goals
and how well they meet their design specification. Reliability as-
sesses whether an agent behaves consistently for the same input
and robustly when input varies or the system encounters errors.
Finally, Safety and Alignment evaluates the agent’s trustworthiness
and security, including fairness, compliance, and the prevention of
harmful or unethical behaviors.
The Evaluation Process dimension describes how agents are as-
sessed. Interaction Mode distinguishes between static evaluation,
where agents respond to fixed inputs, and interactive assessment,
where agents engage with users. Evaluation Data discusses both
synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as benchmarks tailored
to specific domains such as software engineering, healthcare, and
finance [23, 62]. Metrics Computation Methods encompasses quan-
titative measures, such as task success and factual accuracy, as
well as qualitative evaluations based on human or LLM judgments.
Evaluation Tooling refers to the supporting infrastructure, such as
instrumentation frameworks (e.g., LangSmith, Arize AI) and pub-
lic leaderboards (e.g., Holistic Evaluation of Agents), that enable
scalable and reproducible assessment. Lastly, Evaluation Contexts
define the environment in which evaluations are conducted, from
controlled simulations to open-world settings such as web browsers
or APIs.
This taxonomy serves both as a conceptual framework and a
practical guide, enabling systematic comparison and analysis of
LLM agents across a wide range of goals, methodologies, and de-
ployment conditions. In the following sections, we examine each
dimension in detail, highlighting key evaluation practices and rep-
resentative studies.
As LLM agents are deployed in increasingly diverse and complex
settings, factors such as single-turn versus multi-turn interactions,
multilingualism, and multimodality all become more important.
While the taxonomy remains applicable across these variations,
tailored metrics and evaluation strategies are often required. We
will discuss these specific adaptations in the relevant sections that
follow.

Evaluation Objectives
3.1
Agent Behavior
Agent behavior refers to the overall performance of the agent as
perceived by a user, treating the agent as a black box. It represents
the highest-level view in evaluation and offers the most direct
insight into the user experience. This category encompasses aspects
such as task completion, output quality, latency, and cost.
3.1.1
Task Completion: Task completion is a fundamental objec-
tive of agent evaluation, assessing whether an agent successfully
achieves the predefined goals of a given task [11, 80, 96, 115]. It
involves determining whether a desired state is reached or if spe-
cific criteria defined for task success are met [57, 93]. Although
sometimes noted for providing limited fine-grained insight into
failures, especially when most models achieve low success rates
[64], task completion remains a predominant and essential measure
of overall agent performance [64].
Task completion is commonly quantified using metrics such as
Success Rate (SR) [11, 57, 64], which can also be referred to as Task
Success Rate [115] or Overall Success Rate [57]. Other related metrics
include Task Goal Completion (TGC) [91] and Pass Rate [76]. Some
evaluations employ binary indicators, such as a reward function
that returns 0 or 1 for goal achievement [42]. Metrics such as pass@𝑘
and pass^𝑘extend this by considering success over multiple trials
[104].
This crucial objective is applied across a wide range of LLM agent
evaluation domains and benchmarks [93]. This includes tasks re-
lated to coding and software engineering, such as resolving GitHub
issues (SWE-bench [40]), scientific data analysis programming (Sci-
enceAgentBench [11]), reproducing research (CORE-Bench [86],
PaperBench [87]), and interactive coding in apps (AppWorld [91]).
It is also extensively used for agents interacting with web envi-
ronments, including general web navigation (BrowserGym [14],
WebArena [126], WebCanvas [73]), multimodal web tasks (Visual-
WebArena [42], MMInA [124]), and realistic time-consuming web
tasks (ASSISTANTBENCH [109]).
3.1.2
Output Quality: Output quality refers to the characteristics
of responses by an LLM agent. It is an umbrella term encompassing
aspects such as accuracy, relevance, clarity, coherence, and adher-
ence to agent specifications or task requirements [80]. An agent
may complete a task yet still deliver a subpar user experience if the
interaction lacks the qualities mentioned above. Output quality is
particularly relevant in evaluating conversational agents, where
user goals are often achieved over multiple turns. Many metrics in
this category overlap with those used in large language model (LLM)
evaluation. For example, the fluency metric is used to measure the
degree to which the output of an LLM satisfies the conventions of
natural language [120]. The logical coherence metric focuses on


===== PAGE 3 =====
Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLM Agents: A Survey
KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada
Figure 1: Taxonomy of LLM Agent Evaluation
the rigor in arguments [120]. As LLM agents may utilize tools for
retrieving grounding information and providing context-aware text
answers, standard metrics used in retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) systems also apply. Such metrics include Response Relevance
or Factual Correctness [21].
3.1.3
Latency & Cost: Latency is a critical aspect of agent behav-
ior, especially in scenarios where users interact with agents syn-
chronously. Long wait times can significantly degrade user experi-
ence and erode trust in the system. A commonly used metric in this
context is Time To First Token (TTFT), which measures the delay
before a user sees the first token of an LLM’s response in stream-
ing mode. For use cases where the agent operates asynchronously,
End-to-End Request Latency—the time to receive the complete re-
sponse—is often more relevant [70].
While cost is not directly observable by end-users, it plays a
crucial role in determining the practicality of deploying agents
at scale. We include cost as a measure of an agent’s monetary
efficiency. It is typically estimated based on the number of input and
output tokens, which directly correlate with usage-based pricing
in most LLM deployments.
3.2
Agent Capabilities
Beyond external behavior, evaluations often target specific capa-
bilities of LLM-based agents that enable their performance. Key
aspects of this category include tool use, planning and reasoning,
memory and context retention, and multi-agent collaboration. Eval-
uating these capabilities helps determine an agent’s strengths and
weaknesses on a more granular level.
3.2.1
Tool Use: Tool use is a core capability for LLM-based agents,
enabling them to retrieve grounding information, perform actions,
and interact with external environments. In this survey, tool use
involves invocation of a single tool and is interchangeable with
function calling; more complex cases of determining tool sequences
for complex tasks will be discussed in 3.2.2. Recent advances have
allowed LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5 and beyond, to support function
calling natively. These models can autonomously decide whether to
invoke a function, select the appropriate one from a candidate set,
and generate the required parameters. As a result, LLM agents can
directly build on the functions of the underlying model, allowing
many of the evaluation techniques originally developed for LLMs
to use tools [47].
The evaluation of the tool’s use involves answering several key
questions. First, can the agent correctly determine whether tool
invocation is necessary for a given task? If so, can it select the
appropriate tool from a defined set of candidates? Once the tool is
selected, the agent must be able to identify the correct parameters
required by the tool and then generate appropriate values for each
parameter to ensure proper execution. In cases where the candidate
toolset is extensive, the agent may also need to retrieve the correct
tool from a repository based on a natural language description of
the task [83].

Several metrics have been proposed to assess these abilities.
Invocation Accuracy [54] evaluates whether the agent makes the
correct decision about whether to call a tool at all. Tool Selection
Accuracy measures whether the proper tool is chosen from a list
of options. Retrieval Accuracy focuses on whether the system can
retrieve the correct tool from a larger toolset, often measured using
rank accuracy 𝑘. For ranking-based evaluation, Mean Reciprocal
Rank (MRR) quantifies the position of the correct tool in the ranked
list. In contrast, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
reflects how well the system ranks all relevant tools[54].
Parameter-related evaluation involves two aspects. The param-
eter name F1 score [83] measures the agent’s ability to identify the
parameter names required for a given function correctly and then
correctly assign values to them. While some evaluations rely on
the correctness of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to check if the tool
call is syntactically valid, this approach may miss semantic errors,
such as incorrect or hallucinated parameter values, especially for
parameters constrained to enumerated types [75]. To address this
limitation, recent work, such as the Gorilla paper, has proposed
execution-based evaluation, in which the system runs the tool calls
and assesses their outcomes, offering a more comprehensive and
grounded assessment of tool use capability [75].
3.2.2
Planning and Reasoning: Planning and reasoning are essen-
tial capabilities for LLM-based agents, especially in complex tasks
that require multiple steps or making decisions under uncertainty.
Planning involves selecting the correct set of tools in an appro-
priate order. At the same time, reasoning enables agents to make
context-aware decisions, either ahead of time or dynamically dur-
ing task execution [37]. T-eval [12] formulated planning evaluation
as comparing the set of predicted tools against a reference. Since
tool order and dependency also matter, some benchmarks adopt
graph-based representations and introduce metrics such as Node
F1 for tool selection and Edge F1 or Normalized Edit Distance for
assessing tool invocation sequences and structural accuracy [83].
In dynamic environments, agents often need to interleave plan-
ning and execution, adapting their actions in response to evolving
context [37]. This pattern is illustrated by the ReAct paradigm,
where agents alternate between reasoning steps and tool usage
[106]. Evaluating such adaptive reasoning requires more than com-
paring static plans—it demands metrics that reflect decision-making
in real time. The T-Eval framework [12] addresses this by intro-
ducing a reasoning metric that assesses how closely an agent’s
predicted next tool call aligns with the expected one at each step.
This captures the agent’s ability to make informed decisions when
tool outputs are not known in advance. Similarly, AgentBoard [64]
proposes the metric Progress Rate, which compares the agent’s ac-
tual trajectory against the expected one, offering a fine-grained
measure of how effectively the agent advances toward its goal.
When agents are instructed to plan in the form of generating
complete multi-step programs, evaluation methods from code gen-
eration become relevant. Benchmarks like ScienceAgentBench com-
pare the generated plans against annotated references using pro-
gram similarity metrics [11]. Additionally, the Step Success Rate has
been proposed to measure the percentage of steps in the generated
plan that are successfully executed, providing a holistic view of
planning quality during execution [28].
3.2.3
Memory and Context Retention: A critical capability for long-
running agents is the ability to retain information throughout many
interactions and apply previous context to current requests. Guan et
al. [31] categorize memory evaluation in multi-turn conversations
by Memory Span (how long information is stored) and Memory
Forms (how information is represented). For example, LongEval
[43] and SocialBench [9] are benchmarks that test an agent’s con-
text retention in long dialogues (40+ turns). An agent might be
given a conversation that spans dozens of exchanges and later
asked questions that require recalling details from early in the
conversation. Maharana et al. [65] demonstrate evaluation with
dialogues spanning hundreds of turns (600+ turns), and Li et al.
[50] introduce memory-enhanced evaluation techniques, tracking
how well agents maintain consistency in long-horizon tasks. These
evaluations often use synthetic or logged conversations as datasets,
and metrics include Factual Recall Accuracy or Consistency Score
(no contradictions between turns). Memory evaluation may also
consider working memory for tool-using agents (i.e., whether the
agent keeps track of intermediate results) and forgetting strategies
(i.e., whether it appropriately forgets irrelevant details to avoid
confusion).
3.2.4
Multi-Agent Collaboration: Evaluating multi-agent collab-
oration in LLM-based systems requires different methodologies
compared to traditional reinforcement learning-driven coordina-
tion [7, 48, 89]. Unlike conventional agents that rely on prede-
fined reward structures, LLM agents coordinate through natural
language, strategic reasoning, and decentralized problem-solving
[32, 33]. These capabilities are crucial in real-world applications
such as financial decision-making and structured data analysis,
where autonomous agents must exchange information, negotiate,
and synchronize decision-making processes efficiently [50, 55]. Au-
tonomous Agents for Collaborative Tasks [55] evaluates Collabora-
tive Efficiency, assessing how well multiple agents share responsi-
bilities and distribute tasks dynamically.
3.3
Reliability
Reliability is a crucial objective, especially as LLM agents are consid-
ered for use in enterprise and safety-critical applications. It encom-
passes consistency, robustness to variations, and trustworthiness of
the agents’ outputs. Unlike task performance (which might measure
best-case capabilities), reliability evaluation probes worst-case and
average-case scenarios.
3.3.1
Consistency: Consistency refers to the stability of the output
when the same task is repeated multiple times [54]. Since LLMs
are inherently non-deterministic, LLM-based agents also exhibit
variability in their behavior. For agents to be trusted in enterprise or
other high-stakes applications, they must demonstrate consistent
performance across repeated runs of the same task. A commonly
used metric in this context is pass@k, which measures the probabil-
ity that an agent succeeds at least once over k attempts. However,
a stricter measure of consistency is whether the agent succeeds
in all k attempts. This is formalized in the 𝜏-benchmark as the
pass^𝑘metric, which better captures the consistency requirements
of mission-critical deployments.

KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada
3.3.2
Robustness: Robustness refers to the stability of an agent’s
output when faced with input variations or changes in the environ-
ment. To remain effective and trustworthy, LLM-based agents must
consistently deliver high performance under a range of challeng-
ing conditions. Evaluating robustness often involves stress-testing
the agent with perturbed inputs—such as paraphrased instructions,
irrelevant or misleading context, or linguistic variations like typos
and dialects—to assess whether it can still complete the task success-
fully. For example, robustness evaluations may involve applying
systematic transformations to standard prompts and measuring the
resulting drop in task success rate or output quality. The HELM
benchmark [51] explicitly incorporates such tests, tracking how
model performance degrades under input variation.
Robustness also encompasses adaptive resilience—the agent’s
ability to recover from dynamic changes in the environment. For
instance, WebLinX [63] examines how agents behave when the
structure of a web page changes during execution. In such settings,
an effective agent must adjust its strategy rather than stall or fail.
In tool-using agents, robustness is further reflected in error-
handling capabilities. As demonstrated in ToolEmu’s evaluation
[82], agents must be able to respond to tool failures or unexpected
outputs gracefully. Robustness tests may include intentionally in-
jecting failures—such as API errors or null responses—to observe
whether the agent recovers (e.g., retries, switches tools, or explains
the issue to the user) or breaks down. A key metric could be the pro-
portion of induced failures that are handled appropriately, reflecting
the agent’s reliability in uncertain or imperfect conditions.
3.4
Safety and Alignment
Safety covers an agent’s adherence to ethical guidelines, avoidance
of harmful behavior, and compliance with legal or policy constraints.
As LLM agents become more powerful and autonomous, the risk
of unintended adverse outcomes (e.g., generating disinformation,
hate speech, or unsafe instructions) grows, making safety eval-
uation indispensable. These evaluations are especially critical in
fields such as financial services, cybersecurity, and autonomous
decision-making, where agent vulnerabilities can lead to severe
consequences [22, 26, 34, 49].
3.4.1
Fairness: The lack of fairness and transparency in AI agents
can result in biased outcomes, decreased users’ trust, and unin-
tended societal consequences [16]. In financial applications, for
example, biased decision-making in loan approvals or investment
strategies can reinforce systemic inequalities (FinCon [111], Auto-
Guide [24]). Ethical concerns also arise in multi-agent interactions,
where decision-making frameworks must ensure compliance with
standards and social norms [67].
Explainability is crucial in enhancing user trust, especially in
interactive systems where AI agents provide recommendations or
automated assistance. Methods such as guideline-driven decision-
making (AutoGuide [24]) and structured transparency mechanisms
(MATSA [66], FinCon [111]) provide users with clear reasoning
paths. Meanwhile, Rjudge [112] analyzes how agents perceive risk
when making autonomous decisions, emphasizing transparency
and trustworthiness in AI interactions. Evaluating these dimen-
sions ensures that AI agents align with ethical standards while
maintaining fairness in their operational contexts.
3.4.2
Harm, Toxicity, and Bias: One aspect of safety is ensuring
that an agent’s outputs do not contain harmful content such as
hate speech, harassment, or extremely biased statements. Evalua-
tion for toxicity often uses specialized test sets and metrics, such
as the RealToxicityPrompts dataset [27] – a collection of prompts
likely to elicit toxic content—where its responses are checked with
automated toxicity detectors or human raters. Metrics include the
percentage of responses containing toxic language or the average
toxicity score (as given by a classifier). HELM [51] includes toxicity
and bias metrics as part of holistic evaluation, indicating how fre-
quently a model produces offensive content or exhibits undesired
biases. For an interactive agent, one might evaluate it by giving
provocative or ethically challenging inputs (red-teaming) and then
measuring its failure rate (how often it responds in an unsafe man-
ner). Safety-focused datasets, such as CoSafe, target exactly this: Yu
et al. introduce CoSafe [110] to evaluate conversation agents on ad-
versarial prompts designed to trick them into breaking safety rules
(e.g., a user subtly asks for self-harm advice or illicit instructions).
CoSafe revealed that even advanced agents had vulnerabilities,
such as falling for coreference-based attacks (where a user refers to
something ambiguously to bypass filters). The evaluation process
involved monitoring the agent’s responses for policy violations
when faced with these adversarial queries. Having a numeric score
(like “agent produced a disallowed response in X% of adversarial
cases”) quantifies safety.
3.4.3
Compliance and Privacy: Beyond avoiding overt toxicity,
many deployments require agents to comply with specific regula-
tory or policy constraints [6, 123]. For instance, a finance chatbot
must not disclose confidential information or provide particular
types of financial advice, and a medical assistant must not deviate
from established medical guidelines. Evaluating compliance may
be highly domain-specific, as it involves scenarios crafted to test
whether the agent respects boundaries (e.g., a user asks the medical
bot for a prescription-only drug recommendation—the correct, safe
behavior is to refuse and advise consulting a doctor).
In enterprise contexts, compliance evaluation may require pro-
prietary test cases that reflect actual policies. One approach is to
integrate those concerns into evaluation frameworks. For example,
the HELM benchmark [51] for enterprises was proposed to include
domain-specific prompts and metrics (such as accuracy on financial
jargon or compliance in responses) for fields like finance and law.
The process involves gathering representative enterprise scenarios
(which may contain confidential or custom data) and designing eval-
uation metrics that reflect real-world success criteria (e.g., Did the
agent follow all legal disclaimer requirements in its response?). For
example, TheAgentCompany [97] evaluates enterprise AI agents
under structured correctness constraints, requiring them to follow
predefined organizational policies when completing tasks.

Evaluation Process
4.1
Interaction Mode
Evaluating LLM agents can occur in various interaction modes
and with different tooling. A fundamental distinction is between
offline evaluation (using pre-generated, static datasets) and online
assessment (involving reactive simulations, humans in the loop, or
live system monitoring).

4.1.1
Static & Offline Evaluation Often performed as a baseline,
offline evaluations typically rely on datasets and static test cases:
collections of tasks, prompts, or conversations that represent chal-
lenges the agent might face. Simulated conversations may be used
to help develop these data, but are ultimately inert between different
runs. Though comparatively cheaper and simpler to run and main-
tain, offline evaluations typically lack the nuance to fully address
the wide range of responses an LLM agent may be able or expected
to provide. As such, they are more prone to error propagation and
are generally less accurate representations of system performance.
4.1.2
Dynamic & Online Evaluation As with other ML systems, on-
line evaluation often occurs after an LLM agent has been deployed.
Instead of relying on synthetic, historical, or manually crafted data,
online evaluations leverage simulations or fundamental user inter-
actions. This adaptive data is crucial for identifying pain points and
issues that are not discovered during static testing and is often rich
in domain context that is more difficult to capture with synthetic or
generalized benchmarks. Dynamic evaluations may use proxies to
simulate users or environments in reactive, real-time response
to agent behavior. For example, in the assessment of web agents,
researchers built web simulators (MiniWoB [85], WebShop [103],
WebArena [126], etc.) where the behavior of an agent (clicking links,
filling forms) can be programmed to verify the correct sequence.
The concept of Evaluation-driven Development (EDD) has
also been proposed [95], proposing making evaluation an integral
part of the agent development cycle. It advocates for continuous
evaluation of the agent, both offline (during development) and
online (after deployment), to detect regressions and adapt to new
use cases. They further outline a reference architecture in which an
AgentOps component monitors agent performance in production
and provides insights back to developers. While still an emerging
idea, it underscores that evaluation is not a one-time task but an
ongoing process, especially for agents that learn or evolve.
4.2
Evaluation Data
The growing interest in evaluating LLM-based agents has led to
the development of diverse datasets, benchmarks, and leaderboards
specifically targeting the agent capabilities discussed in Section 3.

Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLM Agents: A Survey
KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada
Many of these resources are designed to reflect real-world complex-
ity and are built using a mix of human-annotated, synthetic, and
interaction-generated data. For instance, datasets such as AAAR-1.0
[61], ScienceAgentBench [11], and TaskBench [83] provide struc-
tured, expert-labeled benchmarks for assessing research reasoning,
scientific workflows, and multi-tool planning. Others, such as Flow-
Bench [96], ToolBench [38], and API-Bank [47], focus on tool use
and function-calling across large API repositories. These bench-
marks typically include not only the gold tool sequences but also
expected parameter structures, enabling fine-grained evaluation.
In parallel, datasets like AssistantBench [109], AppWorld [91],
and WebArena [126] simulate more open-ended and interactive
agent behaviors in web and application environments. They empha-
size dynamic decision-making, long-horizon planning, and user-
agent interactions. Several benchmarks also support safety and
robustness testing—for example, AgentHarm [5] assesses poten-
tially harmful behaviors, while AgentDojo [17] evaluates resilience
against prompt injection attacks. Leaderboards such as the Berke-
ley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) [100] and Holistic Agent
Leaderboard [88] consolidate these evaluations by providing stan-
dardized test cases, automated metrics (e.g., AST correctness, Win
Rate), and ranking mechanisms to compare systems.
4.3
Metrics Computation Methods
The code-based method is the most deterministic and objective
approach [8, 53, 57]. [8] It relies on explicit rules, test cases, or
assertions to verify whether an agent’s response meets predefined
criteria. This method is particularly effective for tasks with well-
defined outputs, such as numerical calculations, structured query
generation, or syntactic correctness in programming tasks. Its pri-
mary advantage is its consistency and reproducibility, making it
highly reliable for benchmarking. However, code-based methods
are typically inflexible. They struggle with evaluating open-ended
or qualitative responses, such as natural language generation or
creative problem-solving, where correctness is subjective. Despite
this, it remains a fundamental technique for evaluating structured
tasks where correctness is well-defined.
The LLM-as-a-Judge approach [125] leverages the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to evaluate agent responses based on qualita-
tive criteria, assessing responses according to the criteria provided
through instructions. This method has gained traction due to its
ability to handle tasks that are subjective and nuanced, such as
summarization, reasoning, and conversational interactions. One
recent extension of this method is Agent-as-a-Judge [127], where
the evaluation process involves multiple AI agents interacting to
refine the assessment, potentially improving evaluation reliability.
This method is highly scalable and can adapt to complex tasks. As
a result, it has received increasing attention [30, 46].
Human-in-the-loop evaluation remains the gold standard for
subjective aspects (like naturalness and user satisfaction) and safety-
critical judgment calls. Human evaluations can take the form of
user studies, expert audits (where domain experts review agent
outputs), or Crowdworker annotations (where outputs are rated
along dimensions such as relevance, correctness, and tone). This
method offers the highest reliability in open-ended tasks, such as
content generation, strategic decision-making, or dialogue coher-
ence. However, it is expensive, time-consuming, and challenging to
scale, making it impractical for large-scale automated systems that
require frequent evaluations.
4.4
Evaluation Tooling
A notable aspect in the process dimension is the emergence of soft-
ware frameworks and platforms that support automated, scalable,
and continuous agent evaluation workflows. These tools enable
integration of evaluation directly into the development lifecycle,
reflecting a growing movement toward Evaluation-driven Develop-
ment (EDD) [95] in agent building. OpenAI Evals is an open-source
framework that allows developers to specify evaluation tasks and
metrics for models, automating the execution and reporting of
results (though not formally described in academic literature, it re-
flects practical needs) [71]. Other open-source or commercial tools
such as DeepEval [2], InspectAI [3], Phoenix [1], and GALILEO
[25] provide rich analytics, evaluation orchestration, and debugging
capabilities. Moreover, agent development platforms like Azure AI
Foundry [68], Google Vortex AI [29], LangGraph [44], and Amazon
Bedrock [4] increasingly incorporate evaluation features, helping
developers monitor performance, detect regressions, and adapt
agents to evolving user needs. Xia et al. [95] further propose an
AgentOps architecture to continuously monitor deployed agents,
closing the loop between development and deployment through
real-time feedback and quality control.
4.5
Evaluation Contexts
The evaluation context pertains to the environment in which an
evaluation is performed. Similar to software engineering, a tradeoff
exists between more realistic (but often more costly and potentially
less secure) and simpler, more controlled (but usually less represen-
tative of final performance) environments. The context in which a
system is assessed is typically guided by the system’s intended use;
a simpler LLM agent without edit access might be tested in its work-
ing environment directly, whereas an LLM agent designed to work
with and make changes to many intertwined systems will likely
be evaluated in a mocked API or sandbox environment. For less
contained systems, the evaluation context may take the form of a
web simulator, such as MiniWoB [85], WebShop [103], or WebArena
[126]. As the development of an agent continues, the evaluation con-
text often evolves with it, from smaller, mocked API environments
to live deployment as agent performance and trustworthiness are
determined.
5
Enterprise-Specific Challenges
As LLM-based agents transition from research demos to deployment
in enterprise settings, new challenges are emerging. Enterprises
often demand high performance in conjunction with predictable
reliability, compliance with regulations, data security, and maintain-
ability, which are usually overlooked during evaluation. To address
these gaps, we discuss the concerns outlined in the following sec-
tions and outline future directions.
5.1
Complexity from Role-based Access
A key challenge in evaluating LLM-based agents in enterprise set-
tings is the need to account for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),
which governs users’ permissions to access data and services. In
these environments, users operate with varying levels of access


===== PAGE 8 =====

Mahmoud Mohammadi, Yipeng Li, Jane Lo, and Wendy Yip
depending on their roles, and agents acting on their behalf must ad-
here to the same constraints. This introduces complexity into agent
evaluation, as an agent’s ability to retrieve or act on information is
not uniform but contextually bound to the user’s permissions.
To address this, some evaluation frameworks have begun incor-
porating access control constraints into their design. For example,
IntellAgent [45] includes evaluation tasks that require authentica-
tion of user identity and enforce policies that deny access to other
users’ information. By embedding role-specific restrictions into task
generation, these approaches more accurately model how agents
behave in permission-sensitive enterprise contexts.
5.2
Reliability Guarantees
Reliability guarantees are especially important in enterprise set-
tings, where agents are expected to operate within compliance and
auditing frameworks that require deterministic or repeatable be-
havior that is explainable. In such contexts, occasional success is
insufficient; agents must perform reliably across time and usage
scenarios to be considered production-ready.
Evaluating reliability is nontrivial. Because LLM-based agents
are inherently stochastic, measuring consistency requires execut-
ing the same task multiple times and observing the variation in
outcomes. This introduces significant evaluation overhead: run-
ning multiple trials per input can be computationally expensive,
especially when testing complex tasks involving tools, memory,
or multi-agent coordination. Moreover, to draw meaningful con-
clusions, benchmarks must include a representative dataset that
reflects the types of tasks and conditions the agent may encounter.
Some efforts have begun to tackle this challenge. For example,
the 𝜏-benchmark [104] explicitly incorporates the pass^𝑘metric to
evaluate the consistency of an agent. By applying this to domains
such as retail and airline booking, the authors show that current
agents struggle with consistency.
5.3
Dynamic and Long-Horizon Interactions
One major challenge in evaluating LLM-based agents is assessing
their performance on long-horizon tasks in dynamic, evolving en-
vironments. Unlike most current benchmarks that focus on short
episodes or single interactions, real-world enterprise agents often
operate continuously over extended periods while interacting with
users, systems, and data.
Addressing this challenge is essential for understanding how
agents behave over time, particularly in enterprise settings where
reliability, adaptability, and goal alignment are crucial throughout
the agent’s lifecycle. Standard, short-term evaluations cannot cap-
ture phenomena such as performance drift, context retention, or
the cumulative effect of decisions on business outcomes.
To begin tackling this issue, some research efforts have intro-
duced long-running simulations and extended dialogues as evalua-
tion tools. For instance, Park et al. [74] observed generative agents
in a continuously running simulated town environment to study
emergent behaviors across multi-day interactions. Similarly, Maha-
rana et al. [65] evaluated long-term conversational memory through
600-turn dialogues, focusing on how well agents maintain coher-
ence and context over extended conversations.
5.4
Adherence to Domain-Specific Policies and
Compliance Requirements
Another significant challenge in evaluating enterprise agents is
ensuring that they can operate within domain-specific policies and
compliance constraints. Enterprises often enforce strict operational
rules—such as approval workflows, data retention policies, usage
quotas, and legal regulations like GDPR or HIPAA—that must be
respected by agents throughout task execution. Evaluating agents
in such contexts requires more than measuring task success; it
demands verification that agent behaviors align with formal policy
constraints and legal compliance standards. For instance, an agent
generating financial reports must avoid unauthorized access to
confidential forecasts and ensure that generated content adheres
to regulatory reporting standards. Without explicit modeling of
these constraints during evaluation, agents deemed "correct" in
traditional benchmarks may still fail in production due to policy
violations or compliance risks.
6
Future Research Directions
As LLM-based agents continue to grow in complexity and applica-
tion scope, future research must push toward more robust, practical,
and scalable evaluation methodologies. We highlight four key di-
rections that can significantly advance the field:
Holistic Evaluation Frameworks: Current evaluation efforts
often focus on isolated dimensions such as task success, planning
quality, or tool use. However, agents in real-world applications
must simultaneously balance multiple competencies. Future work
should develop holistic evaluation frameworks that assess agent
performance across multiple, interdependent dimensions.
More Realistic Evaluation Settings: To bridge the gap be-
tween lab settings and production environments, agent evaluation
must move toward more realistic conditions. This includes creating
evaluation environments that incorporate enterprise-specific ele-
ments such as dynamic multi-user interactions, role-based access
controls, and domain-specific knowledge. These settings can be
achieved through real-world deployment trials or through simu-
lated environments that mimic enterprise workflows.
Automated and Scalable Evaluation Techniques: Manual
evaluation of agent behavior, especially in multi-turn or long-horizon
scenarios, is costly and complicated to scale. Future research should
explore automated evaluation approaches to reduce human effort
and improve reproducibility. This includes using synthetic data
generation for controllable test cases, leveraging simulated envi-
ronments to emulate task contexts, and advancing LLM-based eval-
uation techniques such as LLM-as-a-judge or Agent-as-a-judge.
Time- and Cost-Bounded Evaluation Protocols: Evalua-
tion must be efficient and able to support iterative agent develop-
ment. Today’s methods—especially those requiring repeated trials
or human-in-the-loop assessments—can be both time- and resource-
intensive. Future research should aim to develop time- and cost-
bounded evaluation protocols that strike a balance between depth
and efficiency.
In summary, future research should focus on developing eval-
uation methods that are holistic, realistic, scalable, and efficient.
These directions are essential for building reliable and trustworthy
LLM-based agents at scale.
