## Guidance Overrides
- Executive Summary: 5-7 sentences; claim -> evidence -> implication.
- Scope & Methodology: Provide an overview of the approach and data sources used.
- Key Findings: 3-6 items with core claim, evidence (research/web), and caveats.
- Trends & Implications: Connect observed trends to near-term decisions for products and organizations.
- Risks & Gaps: Highlight missing evidence and constraints; state Not applicable with reason if not applicable.
- Critics: Short headline + paragraphs + bullets; include contrarian views; state Not applicable with reason if not applicable.
- Appendix: List of used sources and classification (research/web/guides) with evidence strength notes.

## Writer Guidance Additions
- Synthesize across sources; avoid lists of summaries.
- Separate facts from interpretation; label web-derived support.
