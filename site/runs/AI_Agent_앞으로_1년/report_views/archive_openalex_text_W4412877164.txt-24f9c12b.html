Abstract
The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI ap-
plications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and un-
derdeveloped area. This survey provides an in-depth overview of
the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-
dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1) eval-
uation objectives—what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capa-
bilities, reliability, and safety—and (2) evaluation process—how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks,
metric computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy,
we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based ac-
cess to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-
horizon interactions, and compliance, which are often overlooked
in current research. We also identify the future research directions,
including holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation. This work
aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of agent evalua-
tion and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world
deployment.

Introduction
Agents based on LLMs are autonomous or semi-autonomous sys-
tems that use LLMs to reason, plan, and act, and represent a rapidly
growing frontier in artificial intelligence [69, 105]. From customer
service bots and coding copilots to digital assistants, LLM agents
are redefining how we build intelligent systems.
As these agents move from research prototypes to real-world
applications [23, 62], the question of how to rigorously evaluate
them becomes both pressing and complex. However, evaluating
LLM agents is more complex than evaluating LLMs in isolation.
Unlike LLMs, which are primarily assessed for text generation or
question answering, LLM agents operate in dynamic, interactive
environments. They reason and make plans, execute tools, lever-
age memory, and even collaborate with humans or other agents
[20]. This complex behavior and dependence on real-world effects
make standard LLM evaluation approaches insufficient. To make an
analogy, LLM evaluation is like examining the performance of an
engine. In contrast, agent evaluation assesses a car’s performance
comprehensively, as well as under various driving conditions.
LLM agent evaluation also differs from traditional software eval-
uation. While software testing focuses on deterministic and static
behavior, LLM agents are inherently probabilistic and behave dy-
namically; therefore, they require new approaches to assessing their
performance. The evaluation of LLM agents is at the intersection
of natural language processing (NLP), human-computer interac-
tion (HCI), and software engineering, which demands additional
perspectives.
Despite increasing interest in this space, existing surveys focus
narrowly on LLM evaluation or cover specific agent capabilities
without a holistic perspective [121]. In addition, enterprise appli-
cations bring additional requirements to agents, including secure
access to data and systems, a high degree of reliability for audit
and compliance purposes, and more complex interaction patterns,
which are rarely addressed in the existing literature [107]. This
survey aims to serve as a helpful reference for practitioners and
researchers in the field of agent evaluation. Our contributions in
this survey are twofold.
• We propose a taxonomy of LLM agent evaluation that orga-
nizes prior work by evaluation objectives (what to evaluate,
such as behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety) and
evaluation process (how to evaluate, including interaction
modes, datasets and benchmarks, metrics computation meth-
ods, evaluation tooling, and evaluation environments).

• We highlight enterprise-specific challenges, including role-
based access control, reliability guarantees, long-term inter-
action, and compliance requirements.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes the taxonomy used in this survey paper to analyze the
agent evaluation landscape. Section 3 dives into the first dimension
of the taxonomy, evaluation objectives, and focuses on the aspects
of the agent to be evaluated. Section 4 describes the second dimen-
sion, the evaluation process, and focuses on the evaluation method.
Section 5 discusses the challenges of assessing LLM agents in enter-
prise environments. Section 6 outlines open questions and future
research directions to guide the next phase of work in evaluating
LLM agents.

Taxonomy for LLM-based Agent Evaluation
We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy to organize different as-
pects of the evaluation of LLM-based agents, structured along the
axes of Evaluation Objectives (what to evaluate) and Evalua-
tion Process (how to evaluate). This taxonomy is visualized as a
hierarchical tree in 1.
The Evaluation Objectives dimension is concerned with the tar-
gets of evaluation. The first category, Agent Behavior, in this dimen-
sion focuses on outcome-oriented aspects such as task completion
and output quality, capturing how well an agent meets end-users’
expectations. Next, Agent Capabilities emphasize process-oriented
competencies, including tool use, planning and reasoning, mem-
ory and context retention, and multi-agent collaboration. These
capabilities provide insights into how agents achieve their goals
and how well they meet their design specification. Reliability as-
sesses whether an agent behaves consistently for the same input
and robustly when input varies or the system encounters errors.
Finally, Safety and Alignment evaluates the agent’s trustworthiness
and security, including fairness, compliance, and the prevention of
harmful or unethical behaviors.
The Evaluation Process dimension describes how agents are as-
sessed. Interaction Mode distinguishes between static evaluation,
where agents respond to fixed inputs, and interactive assessment,
where agents engage with users. Evaluation Data discusses both
synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as benchmarks tailored
to specific domains such as software engineering, healthcare, and
finance [23, 62]. Metrics Computation Methods encompasses quan-
titative measures, such as task success and factual accuracy, as
well as qualitative evaluations based on human or LLM judgments.
Evaluation Tooling refers to the supporting infrastructure, such as
instrumentation frameworks (e.g., LangSmith, Arize AI) and pub-
lic leaderboards (e.g., Holistic Evaluation of Agents), that enable
scalable and reproducible assessment. Lastly, Evaluation Contexts
define the environment in which evaluations are conducted, from
controlled simulations to open-world settings such as web browsers
or APIs.
This taxonomy serves both as a conceptual framework and a
practical guide, enabling systematic comparison and analysis of
LLM agents across a wide range of goals, methodologies, and de-
ployment conditions. In the following sections, we examine each
dimension in detail, highlighting key evaluation practices and rep-
resentative studies.
As LLM agents are deployed in increasingly diverse and complex
settings, factors such as single-turn versus multi-turn interactions,
multilingualism, and multimodality all become more important.
While the taxonomy remains applicable across these variations,
tailored metrics and evaluation strategies are often required. We
will discuss these specific adaptations in the relevant sections that
follow.

Evaluation Objectives
3.1
Agent Behavior
Agent behavior refers to the overall performance of the agent as
perceived by a user, treating the agent as a black box. It represents
the highest-level view in evaluation and offers the most direct
insight into the user experience. This category encompasses aspects
such as task completion, output quality, latency, and cost.
3.1.1
Task Completion: Task completion is a fundamental objec-
tive of agent evaluation, assessing whether an agent successfully
achieves the predefined goals of a given task [11, 80, 96, 115]. It
involves determining whether a desired state is reached or if spe-
cific criteria defined for task success are met [57, 93]. Although
sometimes noted for providing limited fine-grained insight into
failures, especially when most models achieve low success rates
[64], task completion remains a predominant and essential measure
of overall agent performance [64].
Task completion is commonly quantified using metrics such as
Success Rate (SR) [11, 57, 64], which can also be referred to as Task
Success Rate [115] or Overall Success Rate [57]. Other related metrics
include Task Goal Completion (TGC) [91] and Pass Rate [76]. Some
evaluations employ binary indicators, such as a reward function
that returns 0 or 1 for goal achievement [42]. Metrics such as pass@𝑘
and pass^𝑘extend this by considering success over multiple trials
[104].
This crucial objective is applied across a wide range of LLM agent
evaluation domains and benchmarks [93]. This includes tasks re-
lated to coding and software engineering, such as resolving GitHub
issues (SWE-bench [40]), scientific data analysis programming (Sci-
enceAgentBench [11]), reproducing research (CORE-Bench [86],
PaperBench [87]), and interactive coding in apps (AppWorld [91]).
It is also extensively used for agents interacting with web envi-
ronments, including general web navigation (BrowserGym [14],
WebArena [126], WebCanvas [73]), multimodal web tasks (Visual-
WebArena [42], MMInA [124]), and realistic time-consuming web
tasks (ASSISTANTBENCH [109]).
3.1.2
Output Quality: Output quality refers to the characteristics
of responses by an LLM agent. It is an umbrella term encompassing
aspects such as accuracy, relevance, clarity, coherence, and adher-
ence to agent specifications or task requirements [80]. An agent
may complete a task yet still deliver a subpar user experience if the
interaction lacks the qualities mentioned above. Output quality is
particularly relevant in evaluating conversational agents, where
user goals are often achieved over multiple turns. Many metrics in
this category overlap with those used in large language model (LLM)
evaluation. For example, the fluency metric is used to measure the
degree to which the output of an LLM satisfies the conventions of
natural language [120]. The logical coherence metric focuses on

Figure 1: Taxonomy of LLM Agent Evaluation
the rigor in arguments [120]. As LLM agents may utilize tools for
retrieving grounding information and providing context-aware text
answers, standard metrics used in retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) systems also apply. Such metrics include Response Relevance
or Factual Correctness [21].
3.1.3
Latency &amp; Cost: Latency is a critical aspect of agent behav-
ior, especially in scenarios where users interact with agents syn-
chronously. Long wait times can significantly degrade user experi-
ence and erode trust in the system. A commonly used metric in this
context is Time To First Token (TTFT), which measures the delay
before a user sees the first token of an LLM’s response in stream-
ing mode. For use cases where the agent operates asynchronously,
End-to-End Request Latency—the time to receive the complete re-
sponse—is often more relevant [70].
While cost is not directly observable by end-users, it plays a
crucial role in determining the practicality of deploying agents
at scale. We include cost as a measure of an agent’s monetary
efficiency. It is typically estimated based on the number of input and
output tokens, which directly correlate with usage-based pricing
in most LLM deployments.
3.2
Agent Capabilities
Beyond external behavior, evaluations often target specific capa-
bilities of LLM-based agents that enable their performance. Key
aspects of this category include tool use, planning and reasoning,
memory and context retention, and multi-agent collaboration. Eval-
uating these capabilities helps determine an agent’s strengths and
weaknesses on a more granular level.
3.2.1
Tool Use: Tool use is a core capability for LLM-based agents,
enabling them to retrieve grounding information, perform actions,
and interact with external environments. In this survey, tool use
involves invocation of a single tool and is interchangeable with
function calling; more complex cases of determining tool sequences
for complex tasks will be discussed in 3.2.2. Recent advances have
allowed LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5 and beyond, to support function
calling natively. These models can autonomously decide whether to
invoke a function, select the appropriate one from a candidate set,
and generate the required parameters. As a result, LLM agents can
directly build on the functions of the underlying model, allowing
many of the evaluation techniques originally developed for LLMs
to use tools [47].
The evaluation of the tool’s use involves answering several key
questions. First, can the agent correctly determine whether tool
invocation is necessary for a given task? If so, can it select the
appropriate tool from a defined set of candidates? Once the tool is
selected, the agent must be able to identify the correct parameters
required by the tool and then generate appropriate values for each
parameter to ensure proper execution. In cases where the candidate
toolset is extensive, the agent may also need to retrieve the correct
tool from a repository based on a natural language description of
the task [83].

Several metrics have been proposed to assess these abilities.
Invocation Accuracy [54] evaluates whether the agent makes the
correct decision about whether to call a tool at all. Tool Selection
Accuracy measures whether the proper tool is chosen from a list
of options. Retrieval Accuracy focuses on whether the system can
retrieve the correct tool from a larger toolset, often measured using
rank accuracy 𝑘. For ranking-based evaluation, Mean Reciprocal
Rank (MRR) quantifies the position of the correct tool in the ranked
list. In contrast, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
reflects how well the system ranks all relevant tools[54].
Parameter-related evaluation involves two aspects. The param-
eter name F1 score [83] measures the agent’s ability to identify the
parameter names required for a given function correctly and then
correctly assign values to them. While some evaluations rely on
the correctness of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to check if the tool</pre></main>
