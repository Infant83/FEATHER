- [ ] Lock decision objective and success criteria — define go/no-go thresholds for OpenClaw deployment (scope, data surfaces, impact, and required human-in-the-loop).
- [ ] Validate core sources and inventory alignment — confirm S1–S4, verify provenance, and extract essential decision-worthy facts.
- [ ] Model risks and threats — map operational, data, IAM, and persistence risks; articulate risk appetite and trigger thresholds.
- [ ] Define governance, controls, and observability — specify least privilege, tamper-evident logging, kill-switch, and anomaly monitoring.
- [ ] Design sandboxed pilot — plan non-production scope, credential lifecycle, approvals, monitoring, rollback, and success criteria.
- [ ] Develop decision framework and deployment options — compare restricted pilot, staged rollout, and pause with explicit decision criteria and when/if contingencies.
- [ ] Outline deliverables and next steps — executive memo, 1-page slide outline, talking points, schedule, owners, and escalation paths.
