      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;OpenClaw — Personal AI Assistant&quot;,
      &quot;raw_content&quot;: &quot;# OpenClaw\n\nThe AI that actually does things.\n\nClears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights.  \n All from WhatsApp, Telegram, or any chat app you already use.\n\n[New Introducing OpenClaw →](/blog/introducing-openclaw)\n\n## ⟩ What People Say\n\n[View all community shoutouts →](/shoutouts)\n\n[\&quot;Setup @openclaw by @steipete yesterday. All I have to say is, wow. First I was using my Claude Max sub and I used all of my limit quickly, so today I had my claw bot setup a proxy to route my CoPilot subscription as a API endpoint so now it runs on that. It&#x27;s the fact that claw can just keep building upon itself just by talking to it in discord is crazy. The future is already here\&quot;\n\n@jonahships\\_](<a href="https://x.com/jonahships_/status/2010605025844723765)[\&quot;Tried">https://x.com/jonahships_/status/2010605025844723765)[\&quot;Tried</a> Claw by @steipete. I tried to build my own AI assistant bots before, and I am very impressed how many hard things Claw gets right. Persistent memory, persona onboarding, comms integration, heartbeats. A few minor wrinkles remain, but the end result is AWESOME.\&quot;\n\n@AryehDubois](<a href="https://x.com/AryehDubois/status/2011742378655432791)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve">https://x.com/AryehDubois/status/2011742378655432791)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve</a> been saying for like six months that even if LLMs suddenly stopped improving, we could spend \\*years\\* discovering new transformative uses. @openclaw feels like that kind of \&quot;just had to glue all the parts together\&quot; leap forward. Incredible experience.\&quot;\n\n@markjaquith](<a href="https://x.com/markjaquith/status/2010430366944055433)[\&quot;Why">https://x.com/markjaquith/status/2010430366944055433)[\&quot;Why</a> @openclaw is nuts: your context and skills live on YOUR computer, not a walled garden. It&#x27;s open source. Growing community building skills. Only 19 days old and constantly improving. &#x27;Personal AI assistant&#x27; undersells it — it&#x27;s a company assistant, family assistant, team tool. Proactive AF: cron jobs, reminders, background tasks. Memory is amazing, context persists 24/7.\&quot;\n\n@danpeguine](<a href="https://x.com/danpeguine/status/2014760164113477700)[\&quot;Yeah">https://x.com/danpeguine/status/2014760164113477700)[\&quot;Yeah</a> this was 1,000% worth it. Separate Claude subscription + Claw, managing Claude Code / Codex sessions I can kick off anywhere, autonomously running tests on my app and capturing errors through a sentry webhook then resolving them and opening PRs... The future is here.\&quot;\n\n@nateliason](<a href="https://x.com/nateliason/status/2013725082850414592)[\&quot;A">https://x.com/nateliason/status/2013725082850414592)[\&quot;A</a> smart model with eyes and hands at a desk with keyboard and mouse. You message it like a coworker and it does everything a person could do with that Mac mini. That&#x27;s what you have now.\&quot;\n\n@nathanclark\\_](<a href="https://x.com/nathanclark_/status/2014647048612773912)[\&quot;OpenClaw">https://x.com/nathanclark_/status/2014647048612773912)[\&quot;OpenClaw</a> is a 24/7 assistant with access to its own computer. What if there were ten, or a hundred, or a thousand?? All running 24/7 in the cloud with access to your files, Gmail, calendar, everything about you... That&#x27;s the future, and we&#x27;re living it today.\&quot;\n\n@nickvasiles](<a href="https://x.com/nickvasiles/status/2014790519529095447)[\&quot;At">https://x.com/nickvasiles/status/2014790519529095447)[\&quot;At</a> this point I don&#x27;t even know what to call @openclaw. It is something new. After a few weeks in with it, this is the first time I have felt like I am living in the future since the launch of ChatGPT.\&quot;\n\n@davemorin](<a href="https://x.com/davemorin/status/2013723700668096605)[\&quot;OpenClaw">https://x.com/davemorin/status/2013723700668096605)[\&quot;OpenClaw</a> is the first \&quot;software\&quot; in ages for which I constantly check for new releases on GitHub. It&#x27;s hard to put into words. It&#x27;s a special project.\&quot;\n\n@cnakazawa](<a href="https://x.com/cnakazawa/status/2014145277465432519)[\&quot;When">https://x.com/cnakazawa/status/2014145277465432519)[\&quot;When</a> you experience @openclaw it gives the same kick as when we first saw the power of ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude Code. You realize that a fundamental shift is happening on how we use AI.\&quot;\n\n@abhi\\_\\_katiyar](<a href="https://x.com/abhi__katiyar/status/2014187653600526474)[\&quot;It&#x27;s">https://x.com/abhi__katiyar/status/2014187653600526474)[\&quot;It&#x27;s</a> running my company.\&quot;\n\n@therno](<a href="https://x.com/therno/status/2014216984267780431)[\&quot;After">https://x.com/therno/status/2014216984267780431)[\&quot;After</a> years of AI hype, I thought nothing could faze me. Then I installed @openclaw. From nervous &#x27;hi what can you do?&#x27; to full throttle - design, code review, taxes, PM, content pipelines... AI as teammate, not tool. The endgame of digital employees is here.\&quot;\n\n@lycfyi](<a href="https://x.com/lycfyi/status/2014513697557758002)[\&quot;Just">https://x.com/lycfyi/status/2014513697557758002)[\&quot;Just</a> shipped my first personal AI assistant. On WhatsApp. Builds my second brain while I chat. Memory moves across agents (Codex, Cursor, Manus, etc.) And a lot more skills still to plug in. Personal AI is getting real with @steipete&#x27;s @openclaw.\&quot;\n\n@christinetyip](<a href="https://x.com/christinetyip/status/2010776377931575569)[\&quot;It">https://x.com/christinetyip/status/2010776377931575569)[\&quot;It</a> will actually be the thing that nukes a ton of startups, not ChatGPT as people meme about. The fact that it&#x27;s hackable (and more importantly, self-hackable) and hostable on-prem will make sure tech like this DOMINATES conventional SaaS imo\&quot;\n\n@rovensky](<a href="https://x.com/rovensky/status/2010676669124612111)[\&quot;Just">https://x.com/rovensky/status/2010676669124612111)[\&quot;Just</a> got my Winix air purifier, Claude code discovered and confirmed controls working within minutes.

I&#x27;ve also set it up so it knows my Obsidian notes and my Claude sub-agents…incredible stuff!\&quot;\n\n@svenkataram](<a href="https://x.com/svenkataram/status/2010211836038427127)[\&quot;My">https://x.com/svenkataram/status/2010211836038427127)[\&quot;My</a> @openclaw accidentally started a fight with Lemonade Insurance because of a wrong interpretation of my response. After this email, they started to reinvestigate the case instead of instantly rejecting it. Thanks, AI.\&quot;\n\n@Hormold](<a href="https://x.com/Hormold/status/2011133394764382583)[\&quot;I">https://x.com/Hormold/status/2011133394764382583)[\&quot;I</a> just finished setting up @openclaw by @steipete on my Raspberry Pi with Cloudflare, and it feels magical ✨ Built a website from my phone in minutes and connected WHOOP to quickly check my metrics and daily habits 🔥\&quot;\n\n@AlbertMoral](<a href="https://x.com/AlbertMoral/status/2010288787885064227)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve">https://x.com/AlbertMoral/status/2010288787885064227)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve</a> been running OpenClaw on my laptop for a week now. Honestly it feels like it did to run Linux Vs windows 20 years ago. You&#x27;re in control, you can hack it and make it yours instead of relying on some tech giant.\&quot;\n\n@snopoke](<a href="https://x.com/snopoke/status/2010419070123008248)[\&quot;Today">https://x.com/snopoke/status/2010419070123008248)[\&quot;Today</a> was one of those days that I sort of ran to my computer after dropping off my toddler at daycare. Why? Because I got part-way through setting up @openclaw last night and it&#x27;s a portal to a new reality.\&quot;\n\n@kylezantos](<a href="https://x.com/kylezantos/status/2011149783218704803)[\&quot;Got">https://x.com/kylezantos/status/2011149783218704803)[\&quot;Got</a> OpenClaw set up and now I have an AI assistant named Claudia who lives in Telegram, remembers everything I tell her, and can actually \\*do\\* stuff.

All I have to say is, wow. First I was using my Claude Max sub and I used all of my limit quickly, so today I had my claw bot setup a proxy to route my CoPilot subscription as a API endpoint so now it runs on that. It&#x27;s the fact that claw can just keep building upon itself just by talking to it in discord is crazy. The future is already here\&quot;\n\n@jonahships\\_](<a href="https://x.com/jonahships_/status/2010605025844723765)[\&quot;Tried">https://x.com/jonahships_/status/2010605025844723765)[\&quot;Tried</a> Claw by @steipete. I tried to build my own AI assistant bots before, and I am very impressed how many hard things Claw gets right. Persistent memory, persona onboarding, comms integration, heartbeats. A few minor wrinkles remain, but the end result is AWESOME.\&quot;\n\n@AryehDubois](<a href="https://x.com/AryehDubois/status/2011742378655432791)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve">https://x.com/AryehDubois/status/2011742378655432791)[\&quot;I&#x27;ve</a> been saying for like six months that even if LLMs suddenly stopped improving, we could spend \\*years\\* discovering new transformative uses. @openclaw fe</pre></main>
