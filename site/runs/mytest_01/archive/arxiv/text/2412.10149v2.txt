Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation
of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However,
simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the
multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for
the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental
excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than typically required by Machine Learning.
We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of the excited states
of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. To achieve
this we compile the largest known database of organic radical geometries and their UV-vis data, which
we use to train our model. Our trained model gives Root Mean Square (RMS) and mean absolute
errors for excited state energies of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively, improving hugely over ExROPPP
with literature parameters. Four new organic radicals are synthesised and we test the model on their
spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the
way for the high throughput discovery of next generation radical-based optoelectronics.

Introduction
Recent years have shown a great interest in radicals for organic
light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which display internal quantum
efficiencies (IQE) of near 100% and intense emission in the deep
red, NIR and IR spectral regions, features which are unusual and
highly desirable. 1–8 These radical OLEDs, based on organic mono-
radicals, offer an alternative for the next generation of highly ef-
ficient lighting. Furthermore, the optical readout of the quartet
state of some radicals has potential applications in quantum infor-
mation science and paves the way for next-generation molecular
qubits. 9 However, historically many organic radicals have been
non-emissive, such that trial-and-error exploration of chemical
space is inefficient, and there is therefore a large and unmet need
for a method which facilitates the fast, accurate and spin-pure cal-
culation of the low-lying excited states of a wide variety of radical
molecules. Such a computational method would also be invalu-
able for the high-throughput screening of radicals for their UV-
visible spectra. This work focuses on organic monoradicals, i.e.

molecules with only one unpaired electron, however, it should be
noted that the excited state properties of organic biradicals and
organic radicals with many unpaired electrons are generally dif-
ferent to those discussed here. 10,11
Calculating the excited electronic states of radicals is chal-
lenging due to spin-contamination and their multiconfigurational
character. There exist several highly accurate methods for cal-
culation of the excited states of radicals, such as multiconfig-
urational self-consistent field (MCSCF), complete active space
perturbation theory to the 2nd order (CASPT2) and Coupled-
cluster theory, however, these methods are very computationally
expensive, making them unsuitable for high-throughput work-
flows. 12–14 Moreover, computationally cheaper methods such as
conventional Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-
DFT) can lead to spin-contaminated and functional-dependent
results for the electronically excited states of radicals. 15,16 Addi-
tionally, it has been shown that for the most accurate calcula-
tion of excited state energies one must also include nuclear quan-
tum effects. 17 Recently, an alternative, semiempirical method was
developed — ExROPPP (Extended Restricted Open-shell Pariser-
Parr-Pople theory), which is significantly faster, yet as accurate
as higher level methods for calculating excited states of hydro-
carbon radicals. 18 ExROPPP is a based on the Pariser-Parr-Pople
(PPP) Hamiltonian 19–23 with a subsequent Extended Configura-
tion Interaction Singles (XCIS) 24 calculation which ensures spin
purity.
PPP theory has gained recent popularity for predict-
ing electronic properties at a significantly reduced computational

cost. 18,25–29 Being a semiempirical method, PPP theory and con-
sequently ExROPPP requires parameters which must be specified
at the start of a calculation. 19–23 The carbon atom PPP parame-
ters already existing in the literature have been shown to be suc-
cessful for predicting excited state energies for hydrocarbons in
ExROPPP. 18 However, emissive radicals commonly contain nitro-
gen and chlorine atoms, and we are not aware of any consistent,
unified and widely-accepted set of parameters for including het-
eroatoms such as these in PPP theory or ExROPPP. 23,30,31 The ad-
vent of ExROPPP has opened up the possibility of rapid screening
of the electronically excited states of radicals, however, extending
and generalizing this method requires an optimal set of parame-
ters to be found.
In recent years Machine Learning (ML) has become an indis-
pensable tool for the study of chemical systems. 32 Such models
allow for accurate prediction of chemical and physical properties
with huge computational savings compared to methods such as
DFT, provided sufficient data are available, and are often seen
as an alternative to semiempirical and classical force-field meth-
ods. 33 ML has seen numerous applications in predicting energies,
structures and reactivity patterns of molecules and materials. 32–38
Furthermore it has been applied to calculating the excited states
of molecules and simulating excited state potential energy sur-
faces. 33,39–45 However, while a wealth of previous studies have
been successful for closed-shell species, we find very few exam-
ples of ML for the electronically excited states of radicals. In re-
cent work ML was applied to calculate the electronically excited
states of radicals by training on closed-shell molecules, however
to our knowledge, learning the excited states directly from ex-
cited state data of organic radicals themselves has yet to be at-
tempted. 46 Furthermore, typical ML models, in which no strong
priors about the system are assumed at the outset, generally re-
quire large amounts of data, e.g.
the properties of thousands
of molecules or more, in order to be successful 32,33,35 and we
are unaware of any such large datasets for radicals.
In addi-
tion, predicting electronically excited states using ML is chal-
lenging as they are a largely non-local property which cannot
in general be treated using atom-wise descriptors. 42 Moreover,
the prediction of primary outputs of quantum chemistry such as
the N-electron wavefunction (and thus the composition of ex-
cited electronic states) is a highly desirable feature of an ML
model, yet few ML models can predict these quantities for ex-
cited states. 42 There has, however, been much recent interest in
leveraging wavefunction-based descriptors in quantum ML mod-
els allowing them to retain some of the physical intuition of con-
ventional quantum chemistry, and this work follows in a similar
spirit to these developments. 47–49
Due to the lack of sufficient excited state data available in
databases for organic radicals and the aforementioned chal-
lenges, adopting a trusted physical model such as ExROPPP and
learning its optimal parameters may be a viable alternative to
conventional ML for the excited states of radicals. 18,25,26,50–56 Us-
ing such a model also allows for the direct prediction of a variety
of primary quantum chemical quantities such as molecular or-
bitals and transition dipole moments. In this paper we will focus
on predicting molecular UV-visible linear absorption spectra and
leave the computation of emission spectra, which usually requires
excited state geometries that are difficult to acquire, for future re-
search.
The linear UV-visible absorption spectra of organic radicals
are usually characterised by two main features.
These are an
intense absorption (or absorptions) in the UV, usually between
300-400 nm, and a much weaker absorption in the visible. The
weak visible D1 state has been investigated using various levels
of theory (TD-DFT, PPP, MCSCF). 2,9,18 In the special case of al-
ternant hydrocarbons, D1 is a minus combination |Ψ−
i0⟩of the
HOMO-SOMO and SOMO-LUMO excitations and is essentially
dark in the absorption spectrum. 6,18,57–59 Alternant hydrocarbons
are usually non-emissive as non-radiative processes outcompete
fluorescence. 6,17 Conversely, in non-alternant molecules, the D1
state may have significantly higher absorption intensity.
One
widely explored class of non-alternant radicals are those with
a donor-acceptor structure, such as TTM-1Cz, in which the D1
state is bright, charge transfer (CT) in nature and is mostly com-
posed of the HOMO-SOMO excitation. 1,2,9 These radicals are also
highly emissive and have been incorporated into high-performing
OLEDs. 1,2 Another class of emissive radicals have recently been
discovered which lack a donor-acceptor structure and CT char-
acteristics, but instead employ mesityl groups leading to a large
increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield.
However,
mesityl substitution does not significantly affect the absorption
characteristics. 5
In this paper we learn the excited states of organic radicals di-
rectly from their experimental data for the first time. To achieve
this we use a modest amount of published UV-visible absorption
data to learn an optimal set of ExROPPP parameters for organic
radicals containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and chlorine. De-
spite only containing a modest amount of data, we believe our
compiled database of UV-Visible absorption data of π-conjugated
organic radicals to be the largest of its kind. 46 Four new radicals
are synthesised and we test our model on their absorption spec-
tra to demonstrate its predictability and transferability. We find
that the trained model has a significantly higher accuracy than
the model using parameters taken from the literature and is able
to make accurate predictions about the electronic excited states
of unseen molecules.

Methodology
2.1
Data collection
We obtained spectroscopic data for 81 organic radicals from pre-
viously published work whose structures are given in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2. 2,5–7,9,46,60–68 In order to compile a database of suitable rad-
icals, we considered all radicals we could find in the literature
containing only carbon, hydrogen, chlorine and pyrrole, aniline
and pyridine type nitrogen atoms. Those radicals whose spectro-
scopic absorption data could be found were added to the database
along with their data. We also obtained DFT optimised molecu-
lar geometries for these molecules from previous studies. 2,5,9,46,61
However, the molecular geometries for some molecules could not
be found in the literature so these structures were optimised us-
ing unrestricted DFT in GAMESS-US. 69 These data constitute the

training set of the ML ExROPPP model. Further details pertaining
to the collation of the database and geometry calculations can be
found in SI Section I.
The target properties used for training are the energies ED1 of
the the first excited doublet states (D1), the energies Ebrt of the
brightest absorptions in the UV-visible spectra, and Irel.
D1 = ϵD1/ϵbrt
which is the ratio of the molar extinction coefficients of these the
two absorptions, extracted from linear UV-visible absorption spec-
tra. These target properties are similar to those previously used
in ML of molecular spectra 33. Exceptions are made for TTM-1Cz-
An and TTM-1Cz-PhAn whereby due to their unusual electronic
structure, their first excited doublet state (D1) is a dark triplet-
coupled doublet state and the lowest energy bright doublet state
is D2 which is by majority composed of the carbazole HOMO-
TTM SOMO excitation (same orbital parentage as D1 in typical
radicals). 9 Therefore, for these exceptional molecules we fit the
D2 (instead of D1) energy and oscillator strength to the corre-
sponding lowest energy D2 absorption seen in experiment. For
these two molecules, we will group this state (D2) in with the D1
states for all the other molecules when performing the statistical
analyses.
2.2
Training
We train the ExROPPP model on experimental UV-visible data of
known organic radicals, using a fitness function of the computed
energies and intensities compared to those obtained from experi-
ment, which quantifies how well the predictions of the ExROPPP
model fit with the experimental data. The fitness function takes
the form
f =wD1(ED1,calc. −ED1,exp.)2 + wbrt(Ebrt,calc. −Ebrt,exp.)2
+ wI(Irel.
D1,calc. −Irel.
D1,exp.)2,
(1)
where wD1, wbrt and wI are the weights of the three respective
terms in Eq. (1). The weights of the first two terms have units
of eV−2 and wI is dimensionless such that f is a dimensionless
quantity. While there are many other fitness functions which we
could use, such as those based on the theory of optimal trans-
port (between experimental and calculated spectra), we choose
to use the above function as it encapsulates the essential spectral
information of organic radicals which we believe is most impor-
tant to be able to predict and only requires a small amount of raw
spectral data for each radical. 70
Training is achieved by finding a set of ExROPPP parameters
which minimises this fitness function utilising the derivative-free
Nelder-Mead optimiser in Python as shown in Fig. 3. 71 The algo-
rithm first reads in the initial parameters, molecular geometries
and experimental absorption data for all training molecules and
classifies the molecules into hydrocarbons or heterocycles, which
are treated slightly differently. For hydrocarbons, the fitness func-
tion comprises of only energy terms, with wD1 and wbrt set to 1
and wI set to zero as the D1 state for hydrocarbons gives a very
weak absorption in experiment and in ExROPPP has zero oscilla-
tor strength. 57 For heterocycles, all three terms are included with
weights of 1 (except for a few molecules whose bright state data
could not be found, see radicals-spreadsheet.xlsx in Data Avail-
ability). Then the parameters are iteratively varied and the fitness
calculated on each iteration until convergence.
We found that pre-training separately on subsets of molecules
of different heteroatom types to obtain better initial guess pa-
rameters before training on all molecules for all parameters, an
approach which we call ‘stratified’ training, lead to lower errors
than not including these pre-training steps. The results of the
trained model presented in the next section are obtained using
this stratified approach. Details of the training process are dis-
cussed further in SI Section II. These calculations are parallelised
for maximum efficiency.
2.3
Testing on novel radicals
Four new radicals: M2TTM-4Me, M2TTM-3PCz, M2TTM-3TPA
and M2TTM-4TPA, shown in Fig. 6 were synthesised, their UV-
visible absorption spectra were measured, and their minimum
energy geometries were obtained using DFT. The spectroscopic
data (ED1, Ebrt and Irel.
D1) and molecular structures of these new
molecules form a testing set for the ML ExROPPP model. The
molecular geometries and extracted UV-visible absorption data
of all molecules as well as initial and optimised sets of parame-
ters are available on the UCL Research Data Repository (see Data
Availability).
2.4
Statistical analysis
We calculate root mean-squared errors (RMSE), mean absolute
differences (MAD), R2 and Spearman’s rank correlation coeffi-
cients (SRCC) between the experimental data and the simulated
data for the training and testing set (see SI Section IV C).
2.5
PPP parameterization
We employ largely the same functional form of PPP theory as in
previous work. 18,23,25,26 The parameters of this model are the one-
electron on-site Coulomb ϵµ and hopping t parameters, and two-
electron Hubbard U and distance scaling r0 parameters. We use
the Mataga-Nishimoto form for the two-electron integrals
γµν ≃(µµ|νν)
=
Uµν
1 + rµν/r0,µν ,
(2)
expressed in terms of atomic orbitals, where rµν is the scalar dis-
tance between atoms µ and ν. 23 However unlike Refs. 18,23,25,
26, but similar to Ref. 72 we elect to use an exponentially decay-
ing function which is scaled by the cosine of the dihedral angle for
the hopping term of the form tµν = A exp(−brµν) cos θ. The PPP
parameters are atom specific, with a different ϵµ for each atom
type and different tµν for each pair of types of bonded atoms µ
and ν. There is only one independent Uµµ and r0,µµ for each atom
type, and an average of the parameters for different atom types
is taken for two-electron interactions between two different types
of atoms i.e. Uµν = 1
2(Uµµ + Uνν) and r0,µν = 1
2(r0,µµ + r0,νν).
We use different parameters for pyridine and pyrrole/aniline type
nitrogen atoms due to their different numbers of π-electrons. Car-

the trained parameters with those initially sourced from the liter-
ature. Full details of the parameterisation used can be found in

Results
3.1
Training and Validation
The results of training the 81 molecule model are summarized in
Fig. 4 and Table 1. We find that the accuracy of the simulated ex-
cited state energies improves significantly on training. The RMSE
reduces from 0.86 eV with literature parameters to 0.24 eV for the
trained model and the MAD reduces from 0.80 eV with literature
parameters to 0.16 eV for the trained model. In terms of corre-
lation, we find a marked improvement in R2 from −0.71 to 0.87
and a smaller improvement for SRCC going from 0.79 to 0.88 in
the trained model compared with the literature parameters.
The simulated spectra of the training set are more accurately
reproduced by the trained model than by the model with litera-
ture parameters. To illustrate this we have included the spectra
of two emissive radicals in the training set which are relevant to

optoelectronics: TTM-1Cz and TTM-1Cz-An (see Fig. 5). TTM-
1Cz is a prototypical and widely-studied emissive radical which
has been implemented in functioning OLEDs, and is a good refer-
ence point for the trained ExROPPP model. 1 On the other hand,
TTM-1Cz-An is an atypical organic radical which has a complex
and unusual electronic structure owing to its first excited state be-
ing a quartet and should be a challenging test case for ExROPPP.
TTM-1Cz-An has been investigated for potential applications in
quantum information technology. 9 We find that the trained model
reproduces the D1 (D2 for Cz-An) energies of these molecules
significantly more accurately than does the literature parameters.
The accuracy for the bright states also improves with the trained
parameters.
Furthermore, ExROPPP predicts that the quartet
state of TTM-1Cz-An is lower in energy than the lowest energy
bright state D2 in both sets of parameters, in line with experimen-
tal data and higher-level calculations in the literature. 9 Trained
ExROPPP does produce an extra absorption around 500nm for
both molecules which is not seen in experiment, and could be an
artifact of the choice of fitness function. The fitness only depends
on the energies and relative intensities of the D1 (D2 for Cz-An)
state and the intense bright state and thus does not take into ac-
count other states in the spectrum. Nevertheless, the ability of
the trained ExROPPP model to accurately capture the absorption
spectra and excited state features of both typical and anomalous
radicals shows its flexibility and robustness.
In addition, we employed K-fold cross-validation on the 81-
radical training set to validate the robustness of the model against
data noise, using several different choices of folds. The data noise
is shown to be small for all trials. Artificially (selected by the user)
and randomly distributed folds gave similar errors proving that
the distribution of molecules across folds does not significantly
affect the model. Also, the K-fold results show that the stratified
model has better robustness than the model without pre-training
steps. Further details can be found in the SI Section III.
3.2
Transferability
Here we briefly consider the extent to which the trained ExROPPP
model can reproduce the qualitative orbital structure of radicals.

trained on orbital data.
A qualitative comparison of the singly occupied (SOMO) and
highest occupied (HOMO) molecular orbitals from ExROPPP and
ROHF (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) demonstrates good overall agreement
in both shape and localization, highlighting the transferability of
the ExROPPP-based parametrisation.
In TTM-1Cz, TTM-3NCz,
and M3TTM, the SOMOs remain largely centered on the triaryl-
methyl carbon, with moderate extension onto the phenyl rings,
whereas the HOMOs for TTM-1Cz and TTM-3NCz localize more
strongly on the carbazole substituent. Notably, the local/global
symmetry (e.g., C2 for TTM-1Cz, C3 for M3TTM) and corre-
sponding irreps are preserved. These observations underscore the
physical interpretability and transferability of parameters derived
via an optimizer-assisted physics-informed model, which can ex-
trapolate untrained properties. Minor discrepancies occur for the
M3TTM HOMO, where ExROPPP underestimates the small orbital
coefficients in the outer ring. Further details and figures illustrat-
ing these points are provided in SI Section IV E.
3.3
Novel organic radicals
To test our model, we synthesized four novel trityl radicals, specif-
ically designed to probe various state-of-the-art concepts pre-
viously identified in mono-radical systems (see Fig. 6).
Each
radical was based on a mesitylated TTM framework, which has
been shown to enhance photoluminescence quantum efficiency
(PLQE) by augmenting the radiative decay rate. 5 To evaluate the
ExROPPP model with an asymmetric structure and the absence of
charge transfer (CT), toluene was appended to the unsubstituted
site of the mesitylated trityl radical core through its 4-position.
The three other radicals incorporated CT groups, namely 9-
phenylcarbazole (PCz) and triphenylamine (TPA), which con-
tain non-bonding nitrogen lone pairs. These non-bonding elec-
trons have been shown to enhance photoluminescent efficiency
through a reduction in excitonic coupling to high-frequency vibra-
tional modes. 73 Through the inclusion of PCz and TPA moieties,
we aimed to test the model across electron-donating groups of
varying strengths, with TPA being the stronger donor due to the
hybridization of its nitrogen heteroatom which influences lone
pair availability. Additionally, TPA units were linked to the trityl

radical core through both the 3- and 4-positions to assess accuracy
in predicting spectroscopic outcomes for different stereoisomers.
The combination of mesitylation and non-bonding CT groups pro-
vides a promising strategy for developing highly efficient radical
emitters and it is crucial that the ExROPPP method can predict
outcomes for these cutting-edge radical designs.
The synthesis of the radical species commenced with the
formation of αHM2TTM as previously reported by Murto et.
al.. 5 Following this, αHM2TTM was reacted with the respec-
tive 3- and 4- linked boronic acids of PCz and TPA to form
αHM2TTM-3PCz and αHM2TTM-4TPA. To create the αH pre-
cursors for the other two radical species, the remaining para-
chlorine of αHM2TTM was converted to a boronic ester through
a Miyaura borylation before being coupled with 4-iodotoluene or
3-bromotriphenylamine. To convert into their respective radicals,
all four αH species were subjected to tetrabutylammonium hy-
droxide, to form the monoanion, before being oxidised to the rad-
ical using para-chloranil. M2TTM-4TPA, M2TTM-3TPA, M2TTM-
3PCz and M2TTM-4T were formed in a 13%, 56%, 86% and 37%
yield respectively. UV-vis absorption measurements were carried
out for the radicals in a 0.1 mM toluene solution. All four radicals
display an intense absorption feature around 370-400 nm, which
is characteristic of a local excitation within the TTM radical core.
For M2TTM-3PCz and M2TTM-4TPA, additional absorption peaks
can be seen at 590 and 630 nm respectively. These are attributed
to CT transitions between the electron donating group and the

We find that the four new molecules confirm the structure-
property predictions made in 2020 6 that, in order for a signifi-
cant D1 absorption the molecule should not be an alternant hy-
drocarbon and that the HOMO on the donor (4Me, 3PCz or TPA
in this case) has orbital amplitude on the atom through which it
is joined to the acceptor (TTM). M2TTM-4Me is predicted to have
minimal D1 oscillator strength as it is a de facto alternant hydro-
carbon, as is observed experimentally. M2TTM-3PCz contains a
five-membered ring and a nitrogen, both of which break alter-
nacy symmetry leading to a bright D1 state, as is experimentally
observed. A simple PPP calculation on TPA alone finds that the
HOMO has significant amplitude at the para (4) position but min-
imal amplitude at the meta (3) position, as shown in Fig. 7. This
therefore predicts that the TPA to TTM charge transfer excitation
will be dark in M2TTM-3TPA but bright in M2TTM-4TPA, as is
observed experimentally in Fig. 8. We believe this is the first di-
rect experimental confirmation of the design rule concerning the
HOMO amplitude.
3.4
Testing
We tested the trained 81-molecule model on our four new organic
radicals: M2TTM-4Me, M2TTM-3PCz, M2TTM-3TPA and M2TTM-
4TPA shown in Fig. 6, which make up the testing set. We find
that the trained model performs well on the testing set, predict-
ing both D1 and bright state energies with a significantly higher
accuracy than the literature parameters, as can be seen in Fig. 9.
We also calculated the RMSE, MAD, R2 and SRCC for the testing
data, presented in Table 2. We find similar values for the errors
and correlation metrics for the testing set as seen previously for
the training set, again with RMSE and MAD less than 0.3 eV and
R2 and SRCC of 0.93 and 0.76 respectively. The fact that the
errors (RMSE and MAD) for the testing set are actually slightly
lower than for the training set further indicates that overfitting
did not occur.

M2TTM-4TPA (bottom right) measured in 0.1 mM toluene solution (red), simulated using ExROPPP with literature parameters (blue) and of the
trained 81 molecule ExROPPP model (black). Trained ExROPPP (black) reproduces the experimental spectra (red) more accurately than untrained
ExROPPP with literature parameters (blue).

We also compare the ExROPPP simulated UV-visible absorp-
tion spectra, with both literature and trained parameters, with
the experimental spectra for these four molecules as shown in
Fig. 8. The simulated spectra of all four molecules are signifi-
cantly improved after training. As well as a significant improve-
ment in accuracy of the D1 and bright state energies, the shape
of the spectra are overall also better captured by the trained
ExROPPP model.
The only slight outlier is M2TTM-3TPA, for
which ExROPPP predicts a larger D1 intensity and lower D1
energy than seen in experiment. Overall, however, the trained
model accurately reproduces the absorption spectra of these four
unseen molecules.

Conclusions
In this article we have presented the first demonstration of learn-
ing the excited states of radicals from experimental data.
We
achieve this by using the spin-pure ExROPPP method as a sur-
rogate model, both to avoid the spin-contamination problem, and
to address the limited experimental data in the literature. We find
that the trained ExROPPP model performs far better at computing
spectral features of organic radicals than the literature parame-
ters. Four new radicals are synthesised and we test our model by
comparing computed spectra against experimental data, finding
good agreement and demonstrating its wider applicability as a
predictive model. In future work this model could be further ex-
tended to predicting the emission spectra of radicals, and also to
other atoms and groups common in organic radicals such as O, S
and F, nitrile, nitro, aminoxyl and trifluoromethyl. 60. In summary,
this work serves as a major step forward for high-throughput
screening and inverse molecular design of radicals with applica-
tions in OLEDs and qubits.

Experimental Methods
5.1
Characterization techniques of organic radicals
NMR spectra were acquired using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance III
HD spectrometer (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz). Chemical shifts
are reported in δ (ppm) relative to the solvent peak: chloroform-d

Fig. 9 Regression plot of the excited state energies of the radicals in the
testing set calculated by ExROPPP and compared with experimentally
determined energies. ‘lit.’ refers to the parameters sourced from the liter-
ature and ‘ML’ refers to the parameters of the trained 81 molecule model.
It can be clearly seen that for this testing set the trained ExROPPP model
more accurately reproduces the experimental values than ExROPPP with
literature parameters.
(CDCl3: 1H, 7.26 ppm; 13C, 77.16 ppm) and dichloromethane-d2
(CD2Cl2: 1H, 5.32 ppm; 13C, 53.84 ppm). Mass spectra were ob-
tained on a Waters Xevo G2-S benchtop QTOF mass spectrometer
equipped with a electrospray ionization (ESI) or an atmospheric
solid analysis probe (ASAP). Flash chromatography was carried
out using Biotage Isolera Four System and Biotage SNAP/Sfär Sil-
ica flash cartridges.
