Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation
of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However,
simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the
multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for
the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental
excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than typically required by Machine Learning.
We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of the excited states
of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. To achieve
this we compile the largest known database of organic radical geometries and their UV-vis data, which
we use to train our model. Our trained model gives Root Mean Square (RMS) and mean absolute
errors for excited state energies of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively, improving hugely over ExROPPP
with literature parameters. Four new organic radicals are synthesised and we test the model on their
spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the
way for the high throughput discovery of next generation radical-based optoelectronics.

Introduction
Recent years have shown a great interest in radicals for organic
light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which display internal quantum
efficiencies (IQE) of near 100% and intense emission in the deep
red, NIR and IR spectral regions, features which are unusual and
highly desirable. 1–8 These radical OLEDs, based on organic mono-
radicals, offer an alternative for the next generation of highly ef-
ficient lighting. Furthermore, the optical readout of the quartet
state of some radicals has potential applications in quantum infor-
mation science and paves the way for next-generation molecular
qubits. 9 However, historically many organic radicals have been
non-emissive, such that trial-and-error exploration of chemical
space is inefficient, and there is therefore a large and unmet need
for a method which facilitates the fast, accurate and spin-pure cal-
culation of the low-lying excited states of a wide variety of radical
molecules. Such a computational method would also be invalu-
able for the high-throughput screening of radicals for their UV-
visible spectra. This work focuses on organic monoradicals, i.e.

molecules with only one unpaired electron, however, it should be
noted that the excited state properties of organic biradicals and
organic radicals with many unpaired electrons are generally dif-
ferent to those discussed here. 10,11
Calculating the excited electronic states of radicals is chal-
lenging due to spin-contamination and their multiconfigurational
character. There exist several highly accurate methods for cal-
culation of the excited states of radicals, such as multiconfig-
urational self-consistent field (MCSCF), complete active space
perturbation theory to the 2nd order (CASPT2) and Coupled-
cluster theory, however, these methods are very computationally
expensive, making them unsuitable for high-throughput work-
flows. 12–14 Moreover, computationally cheaper methods such as
conventional Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-
DFT) can lead to spin-contaminated and functional-dependent
results for the electronically excited states of radicals. 15,16 Addi-
tionally, it has been shown that for the most accurate calcula-
tion of excited state energies one must also include nuclear quan-
tum effects. 17 Recently, an alternative, semiempirical method was
developed — ExROPPP (Extended Restricted Open-shell Pariser-
Parr-Pople theory), which is significantly faster, yet as accurate
as higher level methods for calculating excited states of hydro-
carbon radicals. 18 ExROPPP is a based on the Pariser-Parr-Pople
(PPP) Hamiltonian 19–23 with a subsequent Extended Configura-
tion Interaction Singles (XCIS) 24 calculation which ensures spin
purity.
PPP theory has gained recent popularity for predict-
ing electronic properties at a significantly reduced computational

cost. 18,25–29 Being a semiempirical method, PPP theory and con-
sequently ExROPPP requires parameters which must be specified
at the start of a calculation. 19–23 The carbon atom PPP parame-
ters already existing in the literature have been shown to be suc-
cessful for predicting excited state energies for hydrocarbons in
ExROPPP. 18 However, emissive radicals commonly contain nitro-
gen and chlorine atoms, and we are not aware of any consistent,
unified and widely-accepted set of parameters for including het-
eroatoms such as these in PPP theory or ExROPPP. 23,30,31 The ad-
vent of ExROPPP has opened up the possibility of rapid screening
of the electronically excited states of radicals, however, extending
and generalizing this method requires an optimal set of parame-
ters to be found.
In recent years Machine Learning (ML) has become an indis-
pensable tool for the study of chemical systems. 32 Such models
allow for accurate prediction of chemical and physical properties
with huge computational savings compared to methods such as
DFT, provided sufficient data are available, and are often seen
as an alternative to semiempirical and classical force-field meth-
ods. 33 ML has seen numerous applications in predicting energies,
structures and reactivity patterns of molecules and materials. 32–38
Furthermore it has been applied to calculating the excited states
of molecules and simulating excited state potential energy sur-
faces. 33,39–45 However, while a wealth of previous studies have
been successful for closed-shell species, we find very few exam-
ples of ML for the electronically excited states of radicals. In re-
cent work ML was applied to calculate the electronically excited
states of radicals by training on closed-shell molecules, however
to our knowledge, learning the excited states directly from ex-
cited state data of organic radicals themselves has yet to be at-
tempted. 46 Furthermore, typical ML models, in which no strong
priors about the system are assumed at the outset, generally re-
quire large amounts of data, e.g.
the properties of thousands
of molecules or more, in order to be successful 32,33,35 and we
are unaware of any such large datasets for radicals.
In addi-
tion, predicting electronically excited states using ML is chal-
lenging as they are a largely non-local property which cannot
in general be treated using atom-wise descriptors. 42 Moreover,
the prediction of primary outputs of quantum chemistry such as
the N-electron wavefunction (and thus the composition of ex-
cited electronic states) is a highly desirable feature of an ML
model, yet few ML models can predict these quantities for ex-
cited states. 42 There has, however, been much recent interest in
leveraging wavefunction-based descriptors in quantum ML mod-
els allowing them to retain some of the physical intuition of con-
ventional quantum chemistry, and this work follows in a similar
spirit to these developments. 47–49
Due to the lack of sufficient excited state data available in
databases for organic radicals and the aforementioned chal-
lenges, adopting a trusted physical model such as ExROPPP and
learning its optimal parameters may be a viable alternative to
conventional ML for the excited states of radicals. 18,25,26,50–56 Us-
ing such a model also allows for the direct prediction of a variety
of primary quantum chemical quantities such as molecular or-
bitals and transition dipole moments. In this paper we will focus
on predicting molecular UV-visible linear absorption spectra and
leave the computation of emission spectra, which usually requires
excited state geometries that are difficult to acquire, for future re-
search.
The linear UV-visible absorption spectra of organic radicals
are usually characterised by two main features.
These are an
intense absorption (or absorptions) in the UV, usually between
300-400 nm, and a much weaker absorption in the visible. The
weak visible D1 state has been investigated using various levels
of theory (TD-DFT, PPP, MCSCF). 2,9,18 In the special case of al-
ternant hydrocarbons, D1 is a minus combination |Ψ−
i0⟩of the
HOMO-SOMO and SOMO-LUMO excitations and is essentially
dark in the absorption spectrum. 6,18,57–59 Alternant hydrocarbons
are usually non-emissive as non-radiative processes outcompete
fluorescence. 6,17 Conversely, in non-alternant molecules, the D1
state may have significantly higher absorption intensity.
One
widely explored class of non-alternant radicals are those with
a donor-acceptor structure, such as TTM-1Cz, in which the D1
state is bright, charge transfer (CT) in nature and is mostly com-
posed of the HOMO-SOMO excitation. 1,2,9 These radicals are also
highly emissive and have been incorporated into high-performing
OLEDs. 1,2 Another class of emissive radicals have recently been
discovered which lack a donor-acceptor structure and CT char-
acteristics, but instead employ mesityl groups leading to a large
increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield.
However,
mesityl substitution does not significantly affect the absorption
characteristics. 5
In this paper we learn the excited states of organic radicals di-
rectly from their experimental data for the first time. To achieve
this we use a modest amount of published UV-visible absorption
data to learn an optimal set of ExROPPP parameters for organic
radicals containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and chlorine. De-
spite only containing a modest amount of data, we believe our
compiled database of UV-Visible absorption data of π-conjugated
organic radicals to be the largest of its kind. 46 Four new radicals
are synthesised and we test our model on their absorption spec-
tra to demonstrate its predictability and transferability. We find
that the trained model has a significantly higher accuracy than
the model using parameters taken from the literature and is able
to make accurate predictions about the electronic excited states
of unseen molecules.

Methodology
2.1
Data collection
We obtained spectroscopic data for 81 organic radicals from pre-
viously published work whose structures are given in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2. 2,5–7,9,46,60–68 In order to compile a database of suitable rad-
icals, we considered all radicals we could find in the literature
containing only carbon, hydrogen, chlorine and pyrrole, aniline
and pyridine type nitrogen atoms. Those radicals whose spectro-
scopic absorption data could be found were added to the database
along with their data. We also obtained DFT optimised molecu-
lar geometries for these molecules from previous studies. 2,5,9,46,61
However, the molecular geometries for some molecules could not
be found in the literature so these structures were optimised us-
ing unrestricted DFT in GAMESS-US. 69 These data constitute the

training set of the ML ExROPPP model. Further details pertaining
to the collation of the database and geometry calculations can be
found in SI Section I.
The target properties used for training are the energies ED1 of
the the first excited doublet states (D1), the energies Ebrt of the
brightest absorptions in the UV-visible spectra, and Irel.
D1 = ϵD1/ϵbrt
which is the ratio of the molar extinction coefficients of these the
two absorptions, extracted from linear UV-visible absorption spec-
tra. These target properties are similar to those previously used
in ML of molecular spectra 33. Exceptions are made for TTM-1Cz-
An and TTM-1Cz-PhAn whereby due to their unusual electronic
structure, their first excited doublet state (D1) is a dark triplet-
coupled doublet state and the lowest energy bright doublet state
is D2 which is by majority composed of the carbazole HOMO-
TTM SOMO excitation (same orbital parentage as D1 in typical
radicals). 9 Therefore, for these exceptional molecules we fit the
D2 (instead of D1) energy and oscillator strength to the corre-
sponding lowest energy D2 absorption seen in experiment. For
these two molecules, we will group this state (D2) in with the D1
states for all the other molecules when performing the statistical
analyses.
2.2
Training
We train the ExROPPP model on experimental UV-visible data of
known organic radicals, using a fitness function of the computed
energies and intensities compared to those obtained from experi-
ment, which quantifies how well the predictions of the ExROPPP
model fit with the experimental data. The fitness function takes
the form
f =wD1(ED1,calc. −ED1,exp.)2 + wbrt(Ebrt,calc. −Ebrt,exp.)2
+ wI(Irel.
D1,calc. −Irel.
D1,exp.)2,
(1)
where wD1, wbrt and wI are the weights of the three respective
terms in Eq. (1). The weights of the first two terms have units
of eV−2 and wI is dimensionless such that f is a dimensionless
quantity. While there are many other fitness functions which we
could use, such as those based on the theory of optimal trans-
port (between experimental and calculated spectra), we choose
to use the above function as it encapsulates the essential spectral
information of organic radicals which we believe is most impor-
tant to be able to predict and only requires a small amount of raw
spectral data for each radical. 70
Training is achieved by finding a set of ExROPPP parameters
which minimises this fitness function utilising the derivative-free
Nelder-Mead optimiser in Python as shown in Fig. 3. 71 The algo-
rithm first reads in the initial parameters, molecular geometries
and experimental absorption data for all training molecules and
classifies the molecules into hydrocarbons or heterocycles, which
are treated slightly differently. For hydrocarbons, the fitness func-
tion comprises of only energy terms, with wD1 and wbrt set to 1
and wI set to zero as the D1 state for hydrocarbons gives a very
weak absorption in experiment and in ExROPPP has zero oscilla-
tor strength. 57 For heterocycles, all three terms are included with
weights of 1 (except for a few molecules whose bright state data
could not be found, see radicals-spreadsheet.xlsx in Data Avail-
ability). Then the parameters are iteratively varied and the fitness
calculated on each iteration until convergence.
We found that pre-training separately on subsets of molecules
of different heteroatom types to obtain better initial guess pa-
rameters before training on all molecules for all parameters, an
approach which we call ‘stratified’ training, lead to lower errors
than not including these pre-training steps. The results of the
trained model presented in the next section are obtained using
this stratified approach. Details of the training process are dis-
cussed further in SI Section II. These calculations are parallelised
for maximum efficiency.
2.3
Testing on novel radicals
Four new radicals: M2TTM-4Me, M2TTM-3PCz, M2TTM-3TPA
and M2TTM-4TPA, shown in Fig. 6 were synthesised, their UV-
visible absorption spectra were measured, and their minimum
energy geometries were obtained using DFT. The spectroscopic
