 constrained by their reference motion planners, mak-
ing them fragile when the planned motions are dynamically
unstable, a very common issue in HOI, where kinematic
planners often neglect physical feasibility. Learned gener-
ative priors address this limitation by encoding physically
plausible motor memory encoded into policies. One line
of research employs adversarial imitation with discrimina-
tors [47] to learn the motor prior, and later extends to skill
embeddings [48] and conditional control [9, 57].
These
approaches promote motion diversity but remain sample-

inefficient and challenging to scale. A complementary line
distills motor skills into compact latent codes. Earlier work
adopts model learning to train a variational autoencoder
(VAE) [27] based controller [11, 73, 89, 90], while recent
studies pretrain universal trackers [35] and distill them into
latent priors [36], masked policies [58], or offline training
with diffusion models [17, 63, 75]. Yet, these methods are
often limited by the expert converage. Our InterPrior syn-
ergizes the strength of both lines: it first distills large-scale
motion imitators and finetunes it via RL, bridging a genera-
tive controller with versatile conditions while enhancing the
control by alleviating out-of-distribution brittleness.
2.2. Physics-based Human-Object Interaction
Advances in physics-based character control have progres-
sively expandeded the scope of HOI animation. Early ap-
proaches primarily focus on simple object dynamics, such
as striking or sitting [4, 6, 43, 48, 77], whereas recent devel-
opments have extended to complex, scenario-specific sports
and games [1, 30, 38, 67, 68, 71, 79, 93]. Progress has also
been observed in generalizable tasks, such as object carry-
ing and rearrangement [7, 12, 15, 29, 42, 44, 54, 70, 94,
100], predominantly enabled by adversarial imitation learn-
ing, while most systems remain skill-specific, relying on
fixed procedural routines (e.g. approach, grasp, place with
regular-shaped objects). They struggle to adapt to objects
that require careful affordances and fine-grained interaction
skills (e.g., grasping a chair bar with one hand). To address
these limitations, HOI motion imitation [76, 80, 87, 91] has
emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling skill reper-
toires and capturing fine-grained interactions, as it directly
emphasizes precision and stability. Distilling such imitation
policies therefore represents a crucial step toward establish-
ing a versatile HOI controller. However, existing efforts of-
ten exhibit narrow task coverage, emphasizing single-object
proficiency [91] or relying on curated dataset with low-
dynamic and hand-centric skills [37, 39, 59]. Our InterPrior
provides a principled solution for generalizing a generative
controller for agile whole-body loco-manipulation.
3. Methodology
Task Formulation. We aim to learn a policy \pi that oper-
ates in a physics simulator and produces human-object in-
teraction motion from high-level goals rather than full ref-
erence. Such goals can be extracted from a human user
(e.g., steering control), a HOI kinematic motion generator
(see Sec. F), or keypoints from Motion Captured (MoCap)
data. The policy \pi conditions on the current human-object
state and recent history together with these goals, and sam-
ples control signals from its learned distribution to drive the
simulated human or humanoid to interact with the object.
The outcome is a rollout motion sequence that is physically
simulated, follows the provided goals where available, and

Figure 2. Overview of the proposed InterPrior framework. It con-
sists of: (I) full-reference imitation expert training on large-scale
human-object interaction data; (II) distillation of the expert into a
variational policy with a structured latent space for skill embed-
dings; and (III) post-training of the variational policy to enhance
generalization. Blue modules denote the final policy used at in-
ference; green and red modules are training-only components, and
red arrows denote supervision signals (rewards/losses).
