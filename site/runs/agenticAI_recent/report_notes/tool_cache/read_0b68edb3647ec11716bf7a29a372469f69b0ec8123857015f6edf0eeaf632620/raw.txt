Abstract
Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects
at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level
intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while co-
ordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge
naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scal-
ing such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose
and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse con-
texts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body co-
ordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scal-
able framework that learns a unified generative controller
through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training
by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-
reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned
variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal
observations and high-level intent. While the distilled pol-
icy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize
reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale
human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data
augmentation with physical perturbations, and then per-
form reinforcement learning finetuning to improve compe-
tence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these
steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid
manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond
the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors
such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demon-
strate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its
potential for real robot deployment.
1. Introduction
Human-object interaction (HOI) is inherently hierarchical:
humans plan at a high level with sparse intentions, while
detailed limb coordination, balance, and contact emerge
through fast, intuitive motor responses [61]. For instance,
when reaching for a bottle, we plan the hand’s target and
object motion, while the rest of the body follows through
subconscious coordination. Motion imitation policies [87]

have scaled to large HOI skills but rely on explicit plan-
ners for dense full-body and object references. In contrast,
an interaction motor prior should sample feasible loco-
manipulation behaviors from a distribution conditioned on
sparse goals, e.g., next-second hand contact, rather than
simply mimicking deterministic, fully specified trajectories.
To model a distribution over feasible loco-manipulation
behaviors, early work [15, 44] learns a generative controller
via adversarial distributional matching and then uses rein-
forcement learning (RL) to promote task achievement un-
der it. These methods can expand motion coverage beyond
demonstrations, but are hard to scale due to unstable op-
timization, discriminator mode collapse, and handcrafted
task objectives. An alternative is to distill reference imi-
tation policies [37], with goal conditioning [59] achieved
without task-specific design. While these approaches can
absorb large-scale data, they can be brittle when reference
coverage lags far behind the configuration space—as in
loco-manipulation, where even a few object degrees of free-
dom can induce a combinatorial explosion of contact modes
and relative poses with different geometries.
To address these limitations, we introduce InterPrior,
a physics-based HOI controller that is scalable along four
axes (Figure 1). (I) task coverage: a single policy sup-
ports multiple goal formulations, e.g., sparse targets and
their compositions; (II) skill coverage: the same training
recipe scales to large HOI data and enables affordance-rich
interactions beyond simple grasping; (III) motion coverage:
it generates expressive trajectories instead of merely recon-
structing demonstrations; and (IV) dynamics coverage: it
maintains task success under varied physical properties.
Our key insight is that RL finetuning is essential for turn-
ing distillation from data reconstruction into a robust, gen-
eralizable policy. Distillation alone cannot cover the full
HOI configuration space, yet RL applied in isolation of-
ten drifts toward unnatural reward-hacking behaviors. We
therefore use distillation to provide a strong, natural initial-
ization, and apply RL as a local optimizer that improves ro-
bustness while remaining anchored to the pretrained model.
Concretely, we leverage distillation to inherit broad skills
from large-scale HOI demonstrations, by training a masked
conditional variational policy to reconstruct motor control
from sparse, multimodal goals, distilled from a reference
imitation expert. We then RL finetune this policy to con-
solidate its latent skills into a valid interaction manifold.
The finetuning optimizes two objectives: improving suc-
cess on unseen goals and initializations, and preserving pre-
trained knowledge through regularization. It leverages the
pretrained base policy to synthesize natural in-between mo-
tions, with failure states to acquire recovery behaviors, e.g.
re-approach and re-grasp. Together, these steps transform
reconstructed latent skills into a stable, continuous mani-
fold that generalizes beyond the training trajectories.
Our contributions are fourfold.
(I) We present Inter-
Prior, a generalizable generative controller for physics-
based human-object interaction,
encompassing diverse
skills rather than fixed procedural routines (e.g., approach,
grasp, place) typical of prior work.
(II) We develop an
RL finetuning strategy that enables robust failure recovery
and goal execution across varied configurations while main-
taining human-like coordination. The resulting controller
supports mid-trajectory command switching, re-grasps af-
ter failures, and remains stable under perturbations. (III)
We show that our finetuning strategy naturally extends to
novel objects and interactions, functioning as a reusable
prior. (IV) We demonstrate embodiment flexibility by train-
ing on the G1 humanoid [64] with sim-to-sim evaluation
and enabling real-time control via keyboard interfaces.
2. Related Work
Data-driven human interaction animation has progressed
from kinematic models assuming simplified object dynam-
ics [66, 99, 103] to methods generating whole-body motions
with dynamic objects [5, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 33,
45, 49, 50, 74, 76, 83, 84, 88, 92, 97]. However, these kine-
matic approaches often exhibit implausible contact drift and
interpenetration. Such limitations partly arise from existing
HOI datasets [3, 18, 20, 26, 28, 31, 34, 40, 78, 81, 95, 96,
98, 102], which contain spatial or physical inconsistencies
that impede the learning of realistic interactions. Physics-
based methods seek to address this gap but often rely on
early curated datasets [56] focusing on limited yet high-
fidelity hand-centric manipulations [37, 59, 71].
Recent
advances in humanoid hardware [2, 10, 24, 55, 104] have
begun to bridge the virtual and physical domains, though
typically without too much agility. Together, these develop-
ments highlight the need for scalable HOI priors, models
capable of generalizing across tasks, remaining robust to
imperfect data, and synthesizing physically realistic HOIs.
2.1. Physics-based Character Animation
Physics-based character animation learns simulated con-
trollers via RL, e.g., tracking reference motions [46, 101].
Scalability has been improved through multi-clip trackers
with reference planners [23, 69, 72] without or with closed-
loop schemes [60, 82]. Nevertheless, such controllers re-
main constrained by their reference motion planners, mak-
ing them fragile when the planned motions are dynamically
unstable, a very common issue in HOI, where kinematic
planners often neglect physical feasibility. Learned gener-
ative priors address this limitation by encoding physically
plausible motor memory encoded into policies. One line
of research employs adversarial imitation with discrimina-
tors [47] to learn the motor prior, and later extends to skill
embeddings [48] and conditional control [9, 57].
These
approaches promote motion diversity but remain sample-

inefficient and challenging to scale. A complementary line
distills motor skills into compact latent codes. Earlier work
adopts model learning to train a variational autoencoder
(VAE) [27] based controller [11, 73, 89, 90], while recent
studies pretrain universal trackers [35] and distill them into
latent priors [36], masked policies [58], or offline training
with diffusion models [17, 63, 75]. Yet, these methods are
often limited by the expert converage. Our InterPrior syn-
ergizes the strength of both lines: it first distills large-scale
motion imitators and finetunes it via RL, bridging a genera-
tive controller with versatile conditions while enhancing the
control by alleviating out-of-distribution brittleness.
2.2. Physics-based Human-Object Interaction
Advances in physics-based character control have progres-
sively expandeded the scope of HOI animation. Early ap-
proaches primarily focus on simple object dynamics, such
as striking or sitting [4, 6, 43, 48, 77], whereas recent devel-
opments have extended to complex, scenario-specific sports
and games [1, 30, 38, 67, 68, 71, 79, 93]. Progress has also
been observed in generalizable tasks, such as object carry-
ing and rearrangement [7, 12, 15, 29, 42, 44, 54, 70, 94,
100], predominantly enabled by adversarial imitation learn-
ing, while most systems remain skill-specific, relying on
fixed procedural routines (e.g. approach, grasp, place with
regular-shaped objects). They struggle to adapt to objects
that require careful affordances and fine-grained interaction
skills (e.g., grasping a chair bar with one hand). To address
these limitations, HOI motion imitation [76, 80, 87, 91] has
emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling skill reper-
toires and capturing fine-grained interactions, as it directly
emphasizes precision and stability. Distilling such imitation
policies therefore represents a crucial step toward establish-
ing a versatile HOI controller. However, existing efforts of-
ten exhibit narrow task coverage, emphasizing single-object
proficiency [91] or relying on curated dataset with low-
dynamic and hand-centric skills [37, 39, 59]. Our InterPrior
provides a principled solution for generalizing a generative
controller for agile whole-body loco-manipulation.
3. Methodology
Task Formulation. We aim to learn a policy \pi that oper-
ates in a physics simulator and produces human-object in-
teraction motion from high-level goals rather than full ref-
erence. Such goals can be extracted from a human user
(e.g., steering control), a HOI kinematic motion generator
(see Sec. F), or keypoints from Motion Captured (MoCap)
data. The policy \pi conditions on the current human-object
state and recent history together with these goals, and sam-
ples control signals from its learned distribution to drive the
simulated human or humanoid to interact with the object.
The outcome is a rollout motion sequence that is physically
simulated, follows the provided goals where available, and

remains diverse and natural in aspects that are not specified.
Overview. Figure 2 illustrates our three-stage paradigm.
First, we train an expert policy \pi _E for large-scale HOI mo-
tion imitation, incorporating data augmentation, physical
perturbations, and shaped rewards to promote stable whole-
body coordination and precise grasping across diverse con-
figurations (Sec. 3.2). Second, we distill the expert into a
masked conditional variational policy \pi that maps sparse
goal inputs to a multi-modal distribution (Sec. 3.3). Third,
we finetune this policy \pi using RL to enhance robustness
under unseen configurations, employing failure-state resets
to encourage recovery behaviors (Sec. 3.4).
Each stage
is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which
shares a consistent input formulation comprising observa-
tions and goal conditioning, as well as an output action cor-
responding to low-level actuation commands (Sec. 3.1).

Goal Conditioning. The policy is also conditioned on a
set of future goals that specify desired human-object con-
figurations at different horizons. During training, we ex-
tract goals from reference, where each reference yt shares
the same state space as observation xt, including human,
object, and contact components. A corresponding binary
mask mt indicates which components of the reference are
provided to the policy [58].
To capture both near-term
and distant intentions, we employ two types of goal con-
ditioning: (I) a short-ho
