## Mechanistic Insights

In analyzing the mechanistic pathways involved in WSe₂ and typical TMDs under hBN encapsulation and annealing, three principal processes emerge: Se vacancy-linked O₂ dissociation, adsorption energy dynamics, and interface state modification. The encapsulation annealing influences these processes, impacting the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics at low temperatures considerably.

### Se Vacancy and Oxygen Binding
The calculated migration barrier of Se vacancies is 2.3 eV, suggesting limited diffusion under equilibrium at room temperature but enhanced mobility when subjected to electron beam exposure (slide 5). This is critical, as the reaction dynamics and roles of vacancies change with temperature-induced kinetics.

The PL increase observed at oxidation initiation around 400 °C implies significant mechanistic overlap between oxidation and electronic state stabilization (slide 6). Such processes underline the nature of vacancy filling by oxygen and hint at defect state alterations being major players.

### Adsorption and Dissociation
The thermodynamic drive is further articulated through adsorption energy calculations. Adsorption energy of atomic oxygen to Se vacancies is notably high at ~−7.1 eV, whereas the energy for O₂ molecule dissociation on these sites stands at 0.52 eV (slides 8). These metrics underscore the likelihood of stable oxygen binding to vacancies under operational conditions, especially where ambient molecular oxygen remains pervasive.

### Structural and Interface Considerations
Encapsulation also factors in the possibility of removing residual polymers or contaminants and rearranging structural interfaces through annealing. This removal may initially reduce non-radiative recombination paths, resulting in improved PL outcomes. However, a substantial part of the reaction dynamics depends on managing vacancy-driven changes, influencing optical pathways discernibly.

The mechanism thus parses out into three structural phases: initial defect landscape, intermediate interaction with ambient oxygen during thermal treatment, and resulting PL landscape post-anneal. Exemplifying these considerations with real-world testing setups, such as thermogravimetric analysis combined with PL studies, could validate these insights further.
