## Risks & Gaps

In evaluating the WSe₂ encapsulation annealing's effects, several challenges in the methodology and scope of current research emerge. 

1. **Primary Source Limitations:** The key studies referenced, including works from Nanotechnology and Nature Communications, are pivotal yet unavailable for direct review in this archive. This presents a significant limitation to corroborate results or methods cited within our primary PPT source. 

2. **Methodological Constraints:** Techniques such as TEM/STEM, crucial in defect characterization, are restricted by electron beam-induced damage, an artifact risk exacerbated by low target contrast for light elements like O within Se vacancy sites (slide 10). These must be complemented with less invasive techniques such as in situ Raman spectroscopy or EELS to achieve comprehensive defect mapping.

3. **Replication and Reproducibility Challenges:** The current data's dependability further hinges on experimental consistency across diverse device architectures and atmospheric conditions. Detailed procedural transparency and multilaboratory validation are requisite to substantiate findings universally.

4. **Analytical Gaps:** A focused effort on elaborate condition matrices—i.e., varied ambient atmospheres and heating protocols—must be initiated to expose reaction dynamics fully. Isotopic labelling (e.g., using ¹⁸O₂) could definitively trace diffusion paths and binding sites, addressing speculative attribution observed in many current datasets.

Ultimately, a cross-validation strategy employing combinatorial methods and data triangulation can augment confidence in mechanistic models proposed, filling existing research voids effectively.
