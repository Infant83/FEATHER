Here, we report the improvement of optical properties in monolayer TMDs of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, by hBN-encapsulation annealing. Monolayer WSe2 showed 2000% enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and 1000% increased lifetime after encapsulation annealing at 1000 °C, which are attributed to dominant radiative recombination of excitons through dedoping of monolayer TMDs.
