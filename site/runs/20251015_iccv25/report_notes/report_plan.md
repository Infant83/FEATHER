Plan (updated)

- [x] Scope & constraints check — Confirm this run is a Tavily portal crawl + small OpenAlex sample (workshop/challenge-heavy), not a full ICCV’25 main-conference ingest; decide how to phrase limitations up front.
- [x] Enumerate authoritative ICCV’25 entry points — Read `archive/tavily_search.jsonl` + `archive/20251015_iccv25-index.md` to list the highest-signal hubs for “key papers + code”: CVF Open Access (landing + All Papers), ICCV virtual papers page, MMLab accepted list, selected industry “accepted publications” pages (e.g., Amazon; also Apple showed up in Tavily results).
- [ ] Build a “paper universe” extraction sheet — From Tavily results, extract the URLs/patterns needed to later pull paper pages and code/project links at scale (e.g., CVF OA `?day=all` entries → per-paper pages/PDF/supp/arXiv; MMLab rows → `[arXiv]` + `[Project Page]`).
- [ ] (Missing) Define the scalable code-link mining approach explicitly — Decide rules for “code link” sources (CVF paper pages vs arXiv vs project pages vs curated GitHub lists), and how duplicates/conflicts will be handled in the report.
- [ ] Normalize the in-archive OpenAlex sample — Parse `archive/openalex/works.jsonl` to tabulate the 11 downloaded works with: title, venue/context (ICCV workshop/challenge vs off-topic), DOI/arXiv, landing page, PDF URL, and any explicit repo/dataset links in the abstract.
- [ ] Deep-read ICCV-relevant OpenAlex texts — Read the high-signal extracted texts (`W4417156065`, `W4414756887`, `W4417409712`, `W4415254644`, `W4415090288`) to pull: task definitions, datasets (size/splits/modalities), methods, metrics, and verbatim code/dataset URLs for citation.
- [ ] PDF spot checks for evidence gaps — Open the corresponding PDFs to capture tables/leaderboards/dataset specs that may be lost in text extraction; record any additional links (GitHub/Zenodo/Codalab).
- [ ] Synthesize practical impact + gaps — Convert extracted evidence into: (1) “Key resources & code links” table, (2) short technical briefs per key item (what it enables, how to use it), and (3) prioritized research gaps.
- [ ] Draft the final report in `technical_deep_dive` form — Populate sections (Technical Background; Methods & Data; Results & Evidence; Limitations & Open Questions) with anchored citations, and clearly separate what’s verified in-archive vs what requires a follow-up crawl of CVF “All Papers”.
- [ ] (Missing) Validate whether OpenReview listing is in-scope as an authoritative entry point and note it as secondary metadata (useful for venue metadata, but not the main “papers+code” surface compared to CVF OA).
