Abstract:
Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with
unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially
dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally
made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic
and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for
more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications
also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms.
Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials—metamaterials and metasurfaces–can
provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions
or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials,
with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality
engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses,
enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-
based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining
the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap
aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new
opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field
forward–toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

Introduction
FRANCESCO MONTICONE
& N. ASGER MORTENSEN
In the optical sciences–the study of light and light-matter interactions–research primarily
focuses on the optical frequency region of the broader electromagnetic spectrum. This field
encompasses the exploration and manipulation of electromagnetic waves, which have catalyzed
groundbreaking developments over recent decades.
These advancements have led to the
emergence of numerous transformative concepts in photonics, all deeply rooted in the classical
electrodynamics of Maxwell’s equations.
In a sense, all the advancements in the field of optics over the decades and centuries have been
based on shaping materials and progressively relaxing assumptions about their optical response.
Consider, for example, a simple piece of glass. Its macroscopic electromagnetic properties–at
least at the level relevant to, for instance, lens design–are very simple and can be described by
linear, time-invariant, isotropic, local, nonmagnetic, passive, constitutive parameters, namely,
a scalar frequency-dispersive electric susceptibility and the free-space magnetic permeability.
Significant more complexity can be unlocked and accessed by relaxing these assumptions.
For instance, breaking the assumption of linearity gave rise to the field of nonlinear optics,
which gained prominence with the invention of the laser and has had profound implications for
both fundamental science and technology. Relaxing the assumption of an isotropic response
leads, among other things, to polarization-dependent functionalities, while more complex linear
constitutive relations–incorporating effects such as negative constitutive parameters, magneto-
electric coupling, chirality, nonreciprocity, and bianisotropy—have been central to the field
of metamaterials, enabling unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves. Furthermore,
relaxing the assumption of time-invariance is one of the most active areas of research in applied
electromagnetics, photonics, and wave physics, allowing for the breaking of frequency/energy
conservation and time-reversal symmetry. These examples illustrate how efforts to challenge any
of these fundamental assumptions have sparked and motivated entirely new research fields.
Yet, among these assumptions, spatial locality has arguably been the least explored. This
is not to say that nonlocal effects have been overlooked until recently. Early studies date back
to the mid-20th century with even earlier seminal contributions by various authors (for further
details, see Section 2). By the early 1960s, the basic physical mechanisms underlying optical
nonlocality in natural materials were well understood, as in the notable work by Hopfield and
Thomas [1] (the former gained recognition for his work on physical computing and artificial
neural networks, for which he won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics). Part of the Introduction of
this paper is worth quoting here for its clarity [1]: In [the local] approximation, the dielectric
polarization 𝑃within a small volume of radius 𝑟0 (𝑟0 ≪any wavelength involved) depends only
on the value of the electric field inside this volume (at the present time and in the past) and
is not explicitly dependent on the electric field or other parameters outside the volume under
consideration. The term "spatial dispersion" has been used to apply to dielectric behavior for
which the local description is not valid. In general, spatial dispersion refers to the wave-vector
dependence of the dielectric constant. Implicitly contained in the supposition of local dielectric
behavior is the neglect of the transport of energy by any mechanism other than electromagnetic
waves. When energy transport by other mechanisms must be considered anomalous (nonlocal)
dielectric behavior results, often accompanied by new physical phenomena.
Although the fundamental ideas of nonlocality were already present in these early works,
it was only with the advent of the field of plasmonics and nano-optics that their significance
became clearly recognized. In particular, as research in metamaterials and plasmonics started
uncovering extreme forms of light-matter interactions, such as ultra-strong field confinement
and enhancement in plasmonic nanostructures, it became evident that the traditional local
approximation was insufficient. More sophisticated models were required to regularize and

accurately describe how these systems respond to tightly confined electromagnetic fields, which
contain large wavevector components in their spatial spectrum. This need is even more evident
today in the study of nonreciprocal, topological, and time-varying systems, especially those
made of continuous media with negative constitutive parameters, whose overall response often
depends on the large-wavevector behavior of the system [2]. As another example, nonlocal
response is also important for quantum-fluctuation phenomena [3] where spatial correlations in
nonequilibrium quantum systems – often overlooked in local thermal equilibrium approximations
– significantly influence interactions like quantum friction and near-field radiative forces [4]. In
many cases,local models can lead to incorrect or even nonphysical predictions, whereas nonlocal
models correct the asymptotic response for large wave vectors, ensuring a gradual vanishing of
the polarization response.
In this context, nonlocality is both a curse and a blessing. On one hand, it resolves the
unphysical issues of local models and predicts new physical effects that would otherwise be
missed by the local approximation. On the other hand, it also imposes fundamental limits on
how strong and localized light-matter interactions can be.
In parallel to the exploration of nonlocality in natural materials, the field of metamaterials
has enabled the realization of strong artificial nonlocality, emerging–at the "effective medium"
level–from long-range interactions across multiple unit cells or from the response of multipolar
meta-atoms. In this case, nonlocality is clearly a "blessing", offering a powerful new tool
to engineer strongly wavevector-dependent functionalities. "Nonlocality engineering" adds
wavevector as a new degree of freedom in the metamaterial design toolbox, enabling a new
degree of control over the angular response of incident light, strong angular/frequency selectivity,
space compression, multifunctional devices, and much more. Notably, nonlocal metamaterials or
metasurfaces can even be used to perform mathematical operations on an input wavefront by
tailoring their spatial impulse response, using nonlocality for wave-based physical computing
(an incidental but intriguing parallel to the career of one of the pioneers of this field, John J.
Hopfield.)
The goal of this Roadmap is to review the current state of this emerging frontier in optics
and photonics, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities of nonlocality—its curse and
blessing. By surveying recent developments across various aspects of nonlocality, we also aim
to define new directions that will drive this field forward, opening pathways for fundamental
scientific discoveries and technological advancements.
Toward these goals, we have assembled a large collection of contributions from many of the
leaders of this field. The Roadmap consists of thirty-four sections, structured into five parts:
• Part I starts with a general introduction of the concept of nonlocal response in the interaction
of electromagnetic waves with matter (Section 2) and semi-classical hydrodynamics
(Section 3), followed by three sections that explore some of the foundational aspects of this
field in greater detail (Sections 4, 5, 6).
• Part II introduces the continuum framework for nonlocal plasmonics (Section 7), and
continues with discussions of quantum hydrodynamics (Section 8). This is followed by
contributions on density-functional theory approaches in the jellium model (Section 9)
and in atomistic representations (Section 10). Implications of nonlocality for light-matter
interactions are also discussed (Section 11). Finally, aspects of surface-response formalism
are discussed (Sections 12 and 13).
• Part III highlights significant directions that go beyond the nonlocal response of free-
electron bulk metals, ranging from the response of doped semiconductors (Section 14) and
polar dielectrics (Section 15) to the nonlocal behavior of 2D plasmons in graphene and
noble-metal surface-states (Sections 16, 17 and 18), nonlinear and nonlocal effects in 2D
materials (Section 19) and nonlocal chirality in moiré multilayer systems (Section 20).

===== PAGE 8 =====
• Part IV explores the principles, design strategies, and emerging applications of nonlocal
metamaterials and metasurfaces, highlighting their potential to transform modern optics
and photonics. Part IV starts with a general discussion of strong spatial dispersion in
metamaterials and metasurfaces (Section 21) and then explores the role of nonlocality and
the new opportunities enabled by nonlocality engineering in a wide range of meta-structures
for several applications, including hyperbolic metamaterials and metasurfaces (Section 22),
"transdimensional" plasmonic thin films (Section 23), nanorod metamaterials for light
management (Section 24) , spatio-temporal metamaterials (Section 25), metasurfaces with
high spectral/angular control (Section 26), nonlocal metalenses (Section 27), metasurfaces
for space compression (Section 28), electro-optic spatiotemporal nonlocal metasurfaces
(Section 29), and multi-functional meta-optics (Section 30).
• Part V delves into the implications of combining nonlocality with other advanced concepts
to investigate new physics, extreme scenarios, and fundamental limits in photonics.
Topics include the role of nonlocality in topological metamaterials (Section 31) and
nonreciprocal plasmonics (Section 32).
This section also features contributions on
combining transformation optics and nonlocal models to study singular geometries
(Section 33) and it explores the idea of "overlapping nonlocality"—a concept related to,
but distinct from, standard nonlocality–and its impact on the ultimate thickness limits of
optical systems (Section 34).
The Roadmap concludes with some brief remarks by the lead authors (Section 35).
Part I — Fundamental frameworks

Linear-response formalism for nonlocal electrodynamics
N. ASGER MORTENSEN
& FRANCESCO MONTICONE
Overview
The early fundamental contributions to the concepts of nonlocal response and spatial dispersion in
condensed matter physics and electromagnetism arose primarily in the mid-20th century. These
ideas expanded on classical theories of material response to electromagnetic fields by considering
the fact that the response at a given point in a material might depend on the electromagnetic
fields at other, nonlocal points [5]. However, this nonlocal dependence is limited to a vicinity of
the initial point, with the range governed by the underlying microscopic dynamics of the system.
The numerous independent developments in this field make it challenging to present a chrono-
logical or cohesive review that fully honors the significant contributions across quantum physics,
condensed-matter physics, plasma physics, and electrodynamics. The study of nonlocal phenom-
ena is inherently tied to the hydrodynamic framework, including the Navier–Stokes equations of
classical continuum mechanics. Notably, Madelung’s seminal work established a vital connection
between the Hamiltonian formalism of quantum mechanics and the hydrodynamic formalism
of classical physics [6]. Equally important are Bloch’s contributions to the hydrodynamic
descriptions of electrons in solids [7], Landau’s work on the damping of longitudinal waves in
plasmas [8], Lindhard’s quantum mechanical calculations of the nonlocal dielectric response
function of electrons in solids [9], and the development of the Kubo formalism for analyzing the
linear response of quantum systems [10]. Each of these contributions fundamentally addresses
the nonlocal response of the underlying electron systems.
The common implicit assumption. As a general theme, these developments have largely
relied on the common and often intuitive assumptions of a linear and local response of matter
to light fields [11]. Mathematically, Maxwell’s equations are augmented by linearized and
8


===== PAGE 9 =====
spatially local constitutive relations between the relevant fields, such as 𝑫(𝒓) = 𝜀(𝒓)𝑬(𝒓) for the
displacement field 𝑫(𝒓) arising from an applied electric field 𝑬(𝒓) in the spatial point 𝒓. The
use of Ohm’s law 𝑱(𝒓) = 𝜎(𝒓)𝑬(𝒓) is another such example where the induced current density
𝑱(𝒓) is arising from an applied electric field 𝑬(𝒓) in the spatial point 𝒓. However, there is no
fundamental reason to assume that the material’s response will be confined to the exact point of
perturbation.
Current status
Beyond the local-response approximation. Building on the concepts of Taylor expansions, the
Volterra series offers a systematic approach to phenomenologically describe spatio-temporal
nonlocal effects. Assuming a system response 𝒵associated with a system input ℱ, i.e. 𝒵[ℱ],
the linear contribution in the Volterra series is formally expressed as [12,13]
𝒵(𝑡, 𝒓) =
∫𝑡
−∞
𝑑𝑡′
∫
𝑑𝒓′ 𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′; 𝒓, 𝒓′)ℱ(𝑡, 𝒓′),
(1)
where 𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′; 𝒓, 𝒓′) is the spatio-temporal nonlocal response function, with the spatial and
temporal integrals extending over all space and time, naturally subject to the restrictions by
causality [12]. Fig. 1 illustrates the spatio-temporal domain, where the response function is
finite (shaded area), while being strictly zero in the noncausal part. The "time cone" is defined
by the bounds on the speed 𝑣of propagation in the medium, being naturally bounded by the
speed of light 𝑐in vacuum. Thus, causality influences both the temporal and spatial integrals in
Eq. (1). The topics of causality and Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations are being further discussed
in Sec. 4. The nonlocal response function is typically characterized by a finite range 𝜉NL
which phenomenologically reflects the inherent microscopic or mesoscopic properties of the
material [14–16]. Naturally, the phenomenology itself does not include detailed information about
these underlying characteristics. Typical examples of nonlocal electrodynamics associated with
matter excitations include plasmons, excitons, or phonons [17–21]. Starting from a microscopic
Hamiltonian quantum description, the Madelung formalism (see Sec. 6 of this Roadmap) provides
a pathway to a hydrodynamic framework (see Sec. 3 of this Roadmap), which can ultimately be
expressed as a nonlocal response function 𝜒.
The local-response approximation (LRA). The common assumption of spatial locality
naturally emerges by the approximation
𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′; 𝒓, 𝒓′) ≈𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′, 𝒓)𝛿(𝒓−𝒓′),
(2a)
where 𝛿(𝒓) is the Dirac delta function, which exhibits no long-range behavior; it contributes
only when 𝒓′ is identical to 𝒓. The spatial integral in Eq. (1) is now performed straightforwardly,
giving the common LRA result
𝒵(𝑡, 𝒓) ≈
∫𝑡
−∞
𝑑𝑡′ 𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′, 𝒓)ℱ(𝑡, 𝒓).
(2b)
The remaining temporal integral is associated with the frequency-dispersive response, subject to
KK conditions imposed by causality.
Translational invariance. For translationally invariant media, it is useful to Fourier transform
Eq. (1) with respect to the temporal and spatial coordinates, resulting in a form that is particularly
familiar to the communities of condensed-matter physics and solid-state spectroscopy [22]
𝒵(𝜔, 𝒒) = 𝜒(𝜔, 𝒒)ℱ(𝜔, 𝒒),
(3)
with the response function 𝜒(𝜔, 𝒒) now explicitly exhibiting both its temporal and spatial
dispersion through its explicit dependence on both the temporal frequency 𝜔and the spatial wave
vector 𝒒.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration (inspired by Ref. [12]) of the constraints of causality on
the response function 𝜒(𝑡−𝑡′, 𝒓, 𝒓′) and the spatio-temporal integrals in Eq. (1). The
causal regime (gray-shaded) represents the region where the response function can
take non-zero values, while the non-causal regime (orange-shaded) indicates where the
response function is strictly zero. The "time cone" is determined by the characteristic
speed 𝑣of propagation in the medium, ensuring no response occurs from points 𝒓′
located farther from the origin (𝑡, 𝒓) than 𝑣|𝑡′ −𝑡|. The finite range of the spatially
nonlocal response (associated with intrinsic dynamics of the matter) is denoted by 𝜉NL.
Exploiting light fields with the dispersion relation 𝜔(𝑞) = 𝑐𝑞, there has been a natural
preference to account for light-matter interactions within the LRA, which in Fourier space
amounts to the approximation 𝜒(𝜔, 𝒒) ≈𝜒(𝜔, 𝒒→0). This limit is well motivated by the
fact that commonly 𝑞𝜉NL = 𝜔𝜉NL/𝑐≪1 for the most encountered optical materials. In many
cases, the momentum of optical photons is too low, and the nonlocal length scale is too short for
nonlocal effects to have any significant impact. Alternatively, this can be understood as the speed
of light 𝑐being much greater than any intrinsic velocities 𝑣characteristic for excitations in matter.
Consequently, in most practical scenarios, common optical materials can be approximated as
homogeneous and local in their response to light fields. This assumption is largely justified by
the small size of the constituent atoms and their dense arrangement within solids, where all
microscopic length scales are much smaller than the wavelength of light.
Beyond the low-𝒒regime. What would happen if translational invariance were broken or
if we could artificially increase the separation between atoms? In the first scenario, where the
system has small but finite dimensions 𝑎, the relaxation of Noether’s conservation laws [23]
would pragmatically allow probing at finite wavevectors 𝑞∼1/𝑎. In the second scenario,
introducing an artificial lattice constant 𝑎, the associated discrete translational invariance would
enable Umklapp scattering processes [24] among photonic Bloch states [25], which also facilitate
probing at finite wavevectors 𝑞∼1/𝑎(or higher multiples). Manipulating and engineering
a finite 𝑞-response is no longer merely aspirational — the advent of photonic nanostructures
and metamaterials has turned this idea into reality. In recent decades, advancements have
enabled the fabrication of increasingly smaller nanostructures and intricate photonic crystals and
metamaterials with engineered lattice constants, along with improved capabilities for exploring
light fields at sub-wavelength scales, including various photon and electron-based near-field
techniques [26–30]. As a result, we are now moving beyond the traditional paradigm of probing
only the 𝑞→0 limit when investigating naturally occurring nanostructures and artificially

engineered metamaterials. This progress has enabled a deeper fundamental understanding of
nonlocal light-matter interactions, including potential quantum effects within the underlying
matter systems. Simultaneously, it has opened entirely new possibilities for engineering the
complex optical responses of nonlocal metamaterials.
Homogeneous media versus metamaterials. The nonlocal responses of both homogeneous
materials and metamaterials involve spatial dispersion, where field variations influence the optical
response. In homogeneous materials, this nonlocality arises from intrinsic microscopic and
mesoscopic properties, leading to wavevector-dependent effects. In metamaterials, nonlocality
can emerge from the artificial periodicity of the composite with strong interactions between
neighboring resonant meta-units, likewise giving rise to wavevector-dependent effects. These
two interpretations – material-induced and resonance-driven nonlocality – are often discussed
separately, yet they share a common underlying principle: both modify wave propagation by
introducing additional modes and spatial dispersion at different scales. As noted by Podolskiy
during the 2015 Faraday Discussions on nonlocality [31]:
"The drastic difference between nonlocality in homogeneous media studied previously
and nonlocality in metamaterials lies in the origin of additional waves. In homogeneous
materials, the nonlocal response is attributed to the spatial dispersion of the material
itself. In metamaterials, however, nonlocality appears at the ’effective medium’ level; the
response of every component of the metamaterial may remain local, while the granularity
of the composite leads to the spatial dispersion of the effective permittivity."
Recognizing this dual nature of nonlocality is essential for establishing a unified conceptual
framework for nonlocal photonics, as explored throughout this Roadmap.
Short-range approximation. Returning to Eq. (1) we finally offer a short-range version, which
corresponds to retaining terms up to order 𝑞2 in Eq. (3). Initially motivated by Ref. [14], this is
enabled by the introduction of real-space moments of the short-range response function [15,16].
For simplicity, we consider an isotropic scalar response, and we get the following spatial
expression
𝒵(𝜔, 𝒓) ≈

𝜒(𝜔, 𝒓) + 𝜉2
NL∇2
ℱ(𝜔, 𝒓),
(4)
where the first term on the right-hand side emerges as a result of the LRA in Eq. (2a) (corresponding
to 𝑞→0), while in the second nonlocal term with the Laplacian operator, 𝜉NL is the range of
the nonlocal response, being formally defined as the second spatial moment of the response
function [15,16]. This scalar expression can be generalized to vectorial fields and non-scalar
responses, with the nonlocal hydrodynamic model serving as a key example, where a nonlocal
Ohm’s law can be formulated in the form [32]
𝒵(𝜔, 𝒓) ≈

𝜒(𝜔, 𝒓) + 𝜉2
NL∇[∇·]

ℱ(𝜔, 𝒓).
(5)
The change from a Laplacian to a gradient-of-divergence nonlocal correction term introduces
the possibility for additional longitudinal waves [33,34], which is a main difference between
nonlocality in homogeneous (conductive) media versus metamaterials (with local constituents).
Concluding remarks
Having attempted to offer a general introduction to the concept of nonlocal response in the
interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter, the remainder of this first part of the Roadmap
explores some of these foundational aspects in greater detail, and for further insight, we
direct readers to key textbooks [5,35], as well as reviews on the nonlocal electrodynamics of
metals [16,34,36–38] and plasma [39–42].

Overview
The hydrodynamic Drude model. The hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM) constitutes the first
and most straightforward realization of a nonlocal permittivity of metals, with a lifetime that is
approaching a century [7]. It is the direct descendant of the standard Drude theory developed 30
years earlier [43], which describes free electrons in the metal as a gas, whose atoms move freely
until they collide with the heavier nuclei (or, with much smaller probability, with each other).
The corresponding angular-frequency 𝜔-dependent relative permittivity 𝜀is then [24]
𝜀m(𝜔) = 𝜀∞(𝜔) −
𝜔2
𝑝
𝜔(𝜔+ i𝛾) ,
(6)
where 𝜔𝑝=
√︁
𝑛𝑒2/(𝑚e𝜀0) is the plasma frequency (here 𝜀0 is the vacuum permittivity, 𝑒is the
elementary charge, 𝑚e the mass of electrons and 𝑛their density), while 𝛾is a phenomenological
damping rate accounting for the aforementioned collisions. Any contribution to the permittivity
from bound electrons or other mechanisms (e.g. interband transitions) is included via 𝜀∞, which
can be obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution from experimental data, or by
modeling any additional known mechanism as a Lorentzian; for a purely free-electron metal (as
in alkali), 𝜀∞= 1.

HDM emerged as a generalization of the above permittivity to reflect, in an effective manner,
the quantum character of electrons. As quantum particles, they obey Pauli’s exclusion principle,
which inevitably turns the electron gas into a compressible one [7], obeying an equation of motion

Here, 𝒗(𝜔, 𝒓) is the hydrodynamic velocity of the free-electron gas (in general, a function of
position 𝒓and angular frequency, while 𝑬and 𝑩are the electric and magnetic field of the
incident electromagnetic (EM) field, respectively, which is the driving force for the motion of
the electron gas. The hydrodynamic parameter 𝛽is directly proportional to the Fermi velocity
𝑣𝐹of the metal; in particular, for a three-dimensional (3D) electron gas, it takes the value
𝛽2 = 𝑣2
𝐹/3 in the low-frequency limit (𝜔≪𝛾), while 𝛽2 = 3𝑣2
𝐹/5 in the high-frequency (optical)
limit (𝜔≫𝛾) [45]. For more details about the derivation of these values, we direct the reader
to [16,34,46]. The pressure term 𝛽2∇𝑛/𝑛in Eq. (7) can be interpreted as an additional force that
tends to homogenize the electron density.
Using 𝑱= 𝑒𝑛0𝒗to define the current density (where 𝑛0 is the equilibrium electron density,
while the driving EM field induces a perturbation 𝑛1), the equation of motion Eq. (7), together
with the continuity equation, result in the generalized Ohm’s law for HDM,
𝛽2
𝜔(𝜔+ i𝛾) ∇[∇· 𝑱(𝜔, 𝒓)] + 𝑱(𝜔, 𝒓) = 𝜎(𝜔)𝑬(𝜔, 𝒓),
(8a)
where 𝜎is the Drude conductivity. This equation is to be solved coupled to the EM wave equation
∇× ∇× 𝑬(𝜔, 𝒓) = 𝜔2
𝑐2 𝜀∞𝑬(𝜔, 𝒓) + i𝜔𝜇0𝑱(𝜔, 𝒓),
(8b)
where 𝜇0 is the vacuum permeability, and 𝑐= 1/√𝜀0𝜇0 the speed of light in vacuum.
The aforementioned inclusion of quantum pressure has several immediate implications. First
of all, it introduces a degree of spatial extent of induced charges, rather than being strictly
localized at the metal–environment interface. But this means that the centroid of induced charge
is pushed inwards (so-called electron spill-in); thinking in terms of classical harmonic oscillators,
this reduced path increases the strength of the restoring force experienced by the electron cloud,
leading thus to an increase in resonant frequency or, in terms of wavelength, a blueshift of the
LSPs as compared to the predictions of LRA. This is shown in Fig. 2(a), comparing the black
dotted line (LRA) with the light-blue solid one (HDM), for a sodium (Na) sphere of radius
𝑅= 5 nm, described by the Drude model in Eq. (6) with ℏ𝜔𝑝= 5.89 eV, ℏ𝛾= 0.1 eV, and 𝜀∞= 1.
As the NP size becomes smaller, the deviation between HDM and LRA predictions increases,
see, e.g. Fig. 1(a) in Ref. [47]. On the one hand, the LRA spectra converge to the quasistatic
approximation (𝜔𝑝/
√
3 for a metal with 𝜀∞= 1), since the NP behaves increasingly more like a
classic point dipole; on the other hand, the nonlocal length and the shift of the centroid of the
induced charge become more significant compared to the overall NP size, leading to steadily
stronger resonance blueshifts.
The physical origin of the electron spill-in described above can be linked to the optical
excitation of longitudinal waves (plasmons) in metal NPs modeled using the HDM. Longitudinal
waves are not allowed in metals described by Eq. (6), as the permittivity vanishes only at the
plasma frequency, well above the optical range of the EM spectrum. On the contrary, within the
HDM, the convective motion of the electron gas induces a spatial dispersion on the longitudinal
component of the metal permittivity, while leaving the transverse part as given by Eq. (6). Thus,
the dispersion of the longitudinal waves within the metal acquires the form [48]

(9)
13


===== PAGE 14 =====
where 𝑘mL is the longitudinal wavenumber in the metal. Equation (9) shows that for 𝜔< 𝜔𝑝, the
longitudinal waves are evanescent, decaying exponentially in the radial direction into the NP,
giving rise to the aforementioned spill-in. In the limit 𝜔≪𝜔𝑝, the thickness of the spilled-in
surface charges can be estimated as [49]
𝛿mL ∼

𝑘mL
≃
𝜔𝑝
√𝜀∞𝛽,
(10)
which yields 𝛿mL ∼0.1 nm for realistic parameters (see below), in good agreement with the
Thomas–Fermi wavelength in noble metals [50]. This spatial encoding of the HDM has been
exploited for the development of effective, simplified models of nonlocal effects in the optical
response of metal nanostructures [51], which take into account the spill-in of induced charges at
their boundaries. Back to Eq. (9), at 𝜔> 𝜔𝑝, the longitudinal waves become propagating in all
directions, leading to longitudinal bulk plasmons resonances, as shown by the green lines in the
upper panel of Fig. 2(b) (in this case, for a gold (Au) cylinder with 𝜔𝑝= 8.81 eV, ℏ𝛾= 0.075 eV,
𝜀∞= 1 and 𝑣𝐹= 1.39 × 106 m/s [44]). These bulk plasmon resonances have been reported
already since the 1970 [52,53], but their resulting resonances are substantially weaker (notice the
logarithmic scale in the figure) and largely affected by material losses.
Boundary conditions. Finally, the addition of an extra differential equation, and the existence
of longitudinal waves, directly leads to the need of an additional boundary condition, for the
optical response of a nonlocal sphere to be calculated analytically or numerically. Boundary
conditions have been discussed in detail in the past, with different choices often leading to
different physics, as can be seen for example in the spectra of Fig. 2(b), and the striking differences
between the so-called curl-free model [54] (red dotted line) and the implementation following
the so-called Sauter boundary condition [55] (green solid line). This, more natural choice, is
based on the clear, physical understanding that the induced-current component normal to the
metal–environment interface must be equal to zero, i.e. there is no electron spill-out. For 𝜀∞= 1
this boundary condition yields naturally the continuity of the normal component of the electric
field as well, while for 𝜀∞≠1, differences emerge between imposing current or electric field
continuity, which can be directly related to the (to some degree) artificial distinction between
bound and free electrons inherent to the Drude model and HDM [56].
The so-called hard-wall condition introduced above, i.e. the premise that the work function
of the metal is so high that the electron-density profile terminates abruptly at the assumed
interface [57] (see Ref. [58] for a detailed discussion) has been the cornerstone of criticism
towards the traditional HDM, as it fails, by construction, to describe the response of metals where
spill-out is considerable, such as Na [59]. Spill-out shifts the centroid of induced charge outwards,
rather than inwards, thus leading to resonance redshifts, as shown in Fig. 2(a) with a dashed
red line—here, the spectrum is calculated with the surface-response formalism (SRF) based on
Feibelman parameters (see e.g. Ref. [60] as well as Secs. 12 and 13 of this Roadmap). Ways to
relax the hard-wall boundary condition within the framework of HDM have also been proposed,
and are currently in use [61,62]. Finally, we should also mention that HDM, as described here,
also fails to account for the well-known size-dependent broadening of the resonances, already
measured experimentally back in the 1970s [63,64]. This is well reproduced by SRF, while in the
context of HDM it is dealt with by the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) model [65]
[see dark-blue dashed-dotted line in Fig. 2(a)], which extends HDM by allowing 𝛽to become
complex, with the imaginary part describing electron diffusion (and thus increased collisions and
damping), on top of their convective motion.
Current status, challenges and opportunities
HDM solutions and other theoretical models. From the above discussion, it becomes clear that
HDM and its generalizations introduce an additional dimension to the analytical or numerical

treatment of electrodynamic problems. The existence of longitudinal waves, and the additional
boundary condition that is needed, have to be implemented in any solver.
For canonical
architectures such as infinite planes, spheres, and infinitely long cylinders, analytic solutions that
describe the reflection, scattering, and absorption of light when spatial nonlocality is taken into
account can be derived, and this was done already in the 1970s [52,66,67]. But, in order to
be of practical use to the nanophotonics community, this treatment needed to be generalized to
account for more complex particle shapes and configurations, exploited in plasmonics designs.
This triggered a rapid growth of nonlocal computational electrodynamics in the late 2000s and
early 2010s. McMahon and collaborators introduced the simplified curl-free incarnation of HDM
into finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations, essentially by Fourier-transforming
the corresponding version of Eq. (8a) and solving it coupled to the wave equation in the time
domain [54,68]. Fig. 3 displays the squared modulus of the displacement field at the brightest
localized plasmon resonance sustained by cylindrical, square, and triangular Au nanowires
with size 50 nm (see the inset sketching the incident fields). Top and bottom panels present
nonlocal and local FDTD calculations, respectively, illustrating the optical excitation of spurious
longitudinal plasmons below the plasma frequency in the former [54]. Toscano et al. proceeded
directly in the frequency domain, using the finite-element method (FEM) as their tool for solving
coupled differential equations [44,69] using a commercial solver, while Hiremath et al. presented
the full details of a rigorous formulation based on Nédélec finite elements [70]. Fig. 3(b) shows
FEM calculations of the energy loss rate experienced by swift electron interacting with Na (top)
and Au nanospheres [34]. As discussed in the context of experiments, electron-energy-loss
spectroscopy (EELS) allows the characterization of plasmonic resonances with excellent spatial
and spectral precision, and thus, it is also an ideal testbed for nonlocal approaches, here comparing
GNOR versus local predictions.
Combining the strengths of the two methods, HDM was also introduced in discontinuous-
Galerkin time-domain codes [74,75] (see also Sec. 7 of this Roadmap). This method, like FDTD
and FEM, is volume-based, which comes with an increased computational cost, since the entire
simulation domain needs to be discretized. On the contrary, boundary-element methods (BEM)
only need to describe the interface between two different media, and are thus more efficient in
terms of computational time and resources. Fig. 3(c) illustrates the implementations of HDM into
BEM, presenting the extinction cross-section of ellipsoidal nanoparticles (NPs) with different
eccentricity [71], revealing the strong dispersion of the bright and dark plasmonic modes that
they support. Other BEM descriptions of quantum nonlocal effects in metallic nanostructures
can be found in Refs. [29,76,77]. Although most of the theoretical research in this context has
focused on finite systems comprising nanometric-sized metallic elements (such as antennas or
cavities), HDM approaches have also shed light into the optical performance of extended devices.
Thus, Fig. 3(d) shows the comparison between local (top) and nonlocal (bottom) predictions
for the near-field of a nanotip. These maps reveal that spatial dispersion effectively blurs the
structure boundaries, reducing the sensitivity of EM fields to surface roughness with sizes of the
order of 𝛿mL in Eq. (10). Thus, as a result of quantum nonlocality, the optical modes at the tip
suffer lower scattering losses in their propagation towards its apex.
In the literature, the versatile and powerful numerical tools introduced above are complemented
by analytical efforts to introduce nonlocal refinements to local EM models. One of these exploited
the theoretical framework of transformation optics to describe the plasmonic fields sustained by
nanostructures in the quasi-static regime [78]. This approach is illustrated in Fig. 3(e), which
presents the calculation of the absorption cross-section of 30 nm radius Au spherical dimers
separated by nano and subnanometric gaps [73]. The left sketch shows that, through the inversion
of two parallel HDM metal surfaces, sphere dimers with a 𝛽parameter that varies in space is
obtained. The asymmetric orange shell renders Δ𝑑′ ≃𝛿′
mL ∝𝛽′(r′) [49], as defined in Eq. (10)
(the primes indicate the dimer coordinate system). The correct treatment of these mapping effects,

leveraging the geometric interpretation of HDM in Ref. [51], yields the absorption spectra in the
right contour plot, which reproduces correctly the main features of the nonlocal phenomenology
reported experimentally (see later discussion on experiments). Another analytically-inspired
approach shed light into the emergence of electron tunneling effects in these plasmonic gaps.

This consists in the modeling of the medium between the metallic elements through a permittivity
of the form of Eq. (6) with a very large 𝛾, parametrized with electron transmission (ab initio)
calculations [79].
Experiments. The investigation of nonlocal effects in metal nanostructures has attracted much
experimental attention in recent years. Fig. 4 presents a general perspective on the different
optical characterization approaches and sample geometries explored, as well as the nonlocal
phenomenology reported in each experimental configuration. EELS has been instrumental for our
current understanding of nanophotonic systems [29,80]. It has also been a crucial tool enabling the
assessment of surface quantum and nonlocal effects in metal NPs with morphologies presenting
sub-nanometric features. Fig. 4(a) shows EELS measurements of the resonant frequency of
the dipolar plasmonic mode sustained by silver (Ag) spheres with decreasing diameter [81].
The EELS data demonstrate a modal blueshift of ∼0.5 eV from 20 nm to 1 nm diameter, and
a much lower effect on the bulk plasmon resonance at higher frequencies. The authors of this
study linked these observations to quantum confinement effects in the NP conduction-electron
wavefunctions. Their findings were also completely compatible with a hydrodynamic model of
the Ag permittivity as described above, as demonstrated by a subsequent report [82]. Similar
EELS experiments shed light into the disappearance of higher order plasmon modes in isolated Au
NPs, and the occurrence of a different nonlocal phenomenology, modal redshift with decreasing
junction cross-section, in connected Au bowties [83].
Apart from monolithic structures, nanometric gaps (at the encounter between two metallic
elements) have been probably the platform where quantum nonlocality has been investigated
most intensively. Although EELS has also been employed in this geometry [87,88], dark-field
spectroscopy has enabled a deep far-field exploration of gap plasmonic modes. Note that the
systematic far-field probing of nonlocal effects in nanometric NPs is not possible due to their
diminute optical cross-section [89]. Fig. 4(b) plots the position of the lowest plasmonic resonance
sustained by 30 nm radius Au nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) samples in which the gap length
was set through molecular spacers generated by two different techniques: layer-by-layer deposition
(from 25 to 3 nm) and self-assembled monolayers (from 2 to 0.5 nm). These experiments revealed
that, contrary to the continuous redshifting with decreasing gap predicted by local EM calculations,
a saturation of the plasmon resonance was observed, in quantitative agreement with a nonlocal
hydrodynamic model [84] with realistic parameters (𝛽∼106 m/s). These experiments indirectly
established the limits of plasmon-assisted field enhancement within plasmonic gaps, and proved
that NPoM structures function as far-field rulers with Ångström-level precision [90].
The investigation of smaller and smaller plasmonic gaps revealed a regime where the quantum
nature of conduction electrons in metals manifests in a completely different fashion. When the
gap size enters the Ångström range and becomes comparable to the electronic spill-out length,
the conduction electrons can tunnel between NPs, giving rise to charge transfer phenomena
that alter the plasmonic modes at the gap. Fig. 4(c) presents experimental evidence of the
onset in this tunneling regime between two Au atomic-force-microscopy tips [85]. The color
plot renders dark field scattering versus incident wavelength and force applied to approach the
nanotips. The lateral panel plots the electrical conductance through the gap, whose abrupt step
reveals the point of contact between the tips. Through the comparison against full quantum
and quantum-corrected [79] classical simulations, the authors of the study set the onset of
the tunneling regime at 𝑑𝑄𝑅= 0.31 nm (8 nN applied force), where the dispersion of the gap
plasmonic modes changes abruptly. At larger gap sizes (lower forces), the modes redshift with
decreasing distance in the same way as reported in Ref. [84] due to the emergence of strong spatial
dispersion in the Au permittivity. At gaps smaller than 𝑑𝑄𝑅, the modes blueshift with applied
force, which was identified as the fingerprint of the occurrence of charge transfer between the
tips. Apart from EELS and dark-field scattering, the impact of quantum tunneling in plasmonic
gaps has been assessed using nonlinear optical processes. These range from surface enhanced

Raman scattering (SERS) from thiophenol monolayers attached to the surface of Au nanodisk
dimers [91] to third-harmonic generation from alkanethiol monolayers at the gap of Au NPoM
cavities [92].
More recently, advances in nanofabrication techniques have allowed the scrutiny of quantum
nonlocal effects in extended systems, which involve interfacing plasmonic surfaces within areas
larger than the operating wavelength, orders of magnitude larger than the gap between NPs.
Thus, the characterization of the dispersion characteristics of the extremely confined modes
propagating within the nanometric gap, 𝑡𝑑, between two Au flakes could be carried out using
scanning near-field optical microscopy [86]. Fig. 4(d) plots the imaginary part of the effective
mode index of these gap surface plasmons, 𝑛GSP, versus its real part for 𝑡𝑑between 2 and 20 nm

reproduced the experimental observations accurately. These findings revealed that nonlocal
damping, encoded in Im{𝑛GSP}, has a significant impact in propagating plasmon modes confined
at the nanoscale.
Van der Waals heterostructures provide another platform for achieving extreme optical
confinement. Notably, graphene supports surface plasmons at THz frequencies, with naturally
transverse decay lengths on the order of a few nanometers.
Furthermore, the dispersion
characteristics of these plasmon modes can be tuned by adjusting the graphene carrier density.
Coupling THz graphene plasmons to metal structures and other two-dimensional materials
has enabled the characterization and electrical tailoring of quantum nonlocal effects in these
systems [93, 94]. Recently, the interface between inorganic semiconductors, such as indium
antimonide (InSb) or gallium arsenide (GaAs), and metamaterial resonators has also been
explored to investigate the emergence of nonlocal effects at THz frequencies [95,96]. While
the influence of dielectric spatial dispersion in these systems differs significantly from that
observed in nanostructured metals at optical frequencies, these experiments have demonstrated
the universal nature of nonlocal EM phenomena.
Future developments to address challenges
Given that in this Roadmap, the theoretical treatment of quantum nonlocal effects in nanophotonics
systems will be discussed in great detail, we provide here only a brief overview of the broader
prospects of the field, focusing on general insights beyond the specific topics explored in detail
in the following sections. On the theoretical front, a comprehensive framework combining
electrodynamics with ab-initio condensed matter physics is still lacking. Such framework will be
essential to fully capture the quantum phenomenology found in the experiments briefly introduced
above. These were conducted on samples of relevance from an optical perspective, in terms of
size, material complexity and geometrical design. Another promising direction is the effective
integration of nonlocal electromagnetics with quantum optical models, which would enable the
unified description of the quantum nature of electrons and photons on the same footing. However,
both of these avenues face significant challenges in terms of numerical complexity, demanding
substantial efforts in the years ahead. On the experimental side, cleaner experiments are still needed
to efficiently isolate quantum electronic effects in optical measurements, overcoming current
constraints on sample design and detection sensitivity to provide unambiguous measurements of
their strength in devices optimizing photonic functionalities ranging from light collection and
concentration to light-matter interaction and quantum nano-optics.
Concluding remarks
The hydrodynamic Drude model, presented here in its linearized form, remains a foundational
framework for the investigation and interpretation of nonlocal phenomena. Secs. 8 and 7 delve
deeper into the hydrodynamic framework, addressing also physical and computational aspects of
self-consistency and nonlinearities in greater detail.

Imaginary part of nonlocal permittivity: how it localizes absorption and im-
poses limits on field confinement and enhancement in plasmonics
JACOB B. KHURGIN
Overview
Space-time duality in photonics has been recognized since the formulation of Maxwell’s equations,
but only in recent years has it been rigorously studied both theoretically and experimentally [97].
The duality between beam diffraction in space and the dispersion of short pulses in fibers
19


===== PAGE 20 =====
has been demonstrated and applied to phenomena such as temporal lensing. When combined
with nonlinearity, this duality leads to analogies between spatial and temporal solitons. More
recently, space-time duality has been further explored through the introduction of temporal
reflection and photonic time crystals, which serve as full analogs to their spatial counterparts [98].
Simultaneously, nonlocality – whether in natural materials like metals or in artificial metamaterials
– has become a subject of significant interest [99]. Nonlocality is the spatial counterpart to
delayed (non-instantaneous) temporal responses, and in the Fourier domain, it manifests as
wavevector-dependent dielectric permittivity 𝜀(𝜔, 𝒌) – or susceptibility 𝜒(𝜔, 𝒌) – in addition to
its ubiquitous frequency dependence. The permittivity of a material is a complex quantity, with
the real part describing retardation and the imaginary part associated with decay or absorption.
It is well established that the dispersion of the real part of permittivity is linked to the dispersion
of the imaginary part via the Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations. Strong, and even anomalous,
dispersion occurs near absorptive resonances, as first noted by Kundt in 19th Century [100].
This suggests that the presence of dispersion implies the existence of absorption somewhere
in the frequency domain. But what is the spatial analog of this relation? The KK relations
arise from the causality of susceptibility 𝜒(𝜏< 0) = 0 which is manifested in the Fourier
transform being analytic in the upper complex half-plane. In the spatial domain, however, the
nonlocal susceptibility behaves differently, 𝜒𝜔(−𝝆) = 𝜒𝜔(𝝆), and a direct application of the
KK transform is not possible. Since the Fourier transform of a symmetric function is real, the
real and imaginary parts of complex nonlocal susceptibility 𝜒𝜔(𝝆) = 𝜒′
𝜔(𝝆) + 𝑖𝜒′′
𝜔(𝝆) have
their own separate spatial Fourier transforms 𝑋′
𝜔(𝒌) = 𝐹[𝜒′
𝜔(𝝆)] and 𝑋′′
𝜔(𝒌) = 𝐹[𝜒′′
𝜔(𝝆)].
Nevertheless, because the susceptibility 𝑋𝜔(𝒌) still contains frequency dependence and for a
given 𝒌KK relations hold true in temporal domain, it becomes possible under certain conditions
to establish KK-like relationships between the real and imaginary parts in the spatial domain.
It follows then that manifestation of strong spatial dispersion in a material that is nominally
transparent at small wavevectors is usually accompanied by strong absorption somewhere at
higher 𝒌’s. While the nonlocality of the real part of permittivity has been extensively studied,
and several approximations have been developed to describe it effectively, its impact remains
relatively limited. Typically, it results in shifts of resonant frequencies in various plasmonic
and nanophotonic structures. In contrast, the effects of nonlocality on the imaginary part of
permittivity are far more significant. These changes not only contribute to enhanced losses but
also impose a limit on the field confinement enhancement in the aforementioned plasmonic and
nanophotonic structures, as will be briefly discussed below.
Let us begin by examining the simplest scenario of nonlocality in a material with a single
resonance frequency 𝜔0(𝑘) = 𝜔0(0) + 𝑎𝑘2/2, where 𝑎can be positive, as in the case of a
Wannier–Mott exciton [1], or negative, such as in the case of an optical phonon [101]. Since 2𝑎𝑘
is a velocity these examples highlight the fundamental physical origin of nonlocality: the motion
of the medium interacting with light. This interaction causes polarization induced at one point
𝒓−𝝆to propagate to another point 𝒓giving rise to nonlocal susceptibility 𝜒𝜔(𝝆).
Consider the scenario of a positive 𝑎as shown in Fig. 5. For the fixed wavevector 𝒌1, the
susceptibility exhibits a Lorentzian 𝜒𝜔(𝒌1) ∼[𝜔0(𝒌1) −𝜔−𝑖𝛾]−1 profile with a broadening 𝛾.
The real and imaginary components of susceptibility, visualized on the left side of Fig. 5, are
clearly interconnected by the KK relation. At the same time, for fixed frequency 𝜔1 > 𝜔0(0), the
spatial dispersion of susceptibility takes the form of
𝑋𝜔1(𝒌) ∼

𝜔0(0) + 𝑎𝑘2 −𝜔1 −𝑖𝛾
 −1 ∼

𝑘2 −𝑘2
0(𝜔1) −𝑖𝛾/𝑎
 −1 ,
(11)
where the "resonance" wavevector is 𝑘2
0 = [𝜔1 −𝜔0(0)] /𝑎. The spatial dispersion of 𝑋′(𝒌) and
𝑋′′(𝒌) is illustrated at the bottom of Fig. 5 and the KK-like relation between them is apparent.
Note, however, that for 𝜔1 < 𝜔0(0), the 𝑋𝜔1(𝒌) remains real for all wavevectors and a KK-like
relation does not exist. We may conclude that unlike the temporal domain, the presence of

absorption in the spatial domain always implies nonlocal dispersion, but the converse is not
necessarily true.
Current status
Consider now the case of a metal such as gold (Au) or silver (Ag), where in the absence of
scattering, absorption is forbidden at small wavevectors due to momentum conservation. However,
once the wavevector approaches 𝑘0(𝜔) = 𝜔/𝑣𝐹, where 𝑣𝐹is a Fermi velocity, absorption becomes
permitted as indicated by the tilted solid arrow in Fig. 6(a). This phenomenon is called Landau
damping (LD), being also further discussed in Sec. 5. In one dimension the dispersion of resonant
frequency is 𝜔0(𝑘) = 𝑣𝐹𝑘, and a KK-like relation similar to the one depicted in Fig. 5 can be
established. In three dimensions, the resonance broadens as absorption is now allowed for all
𝑘≥𝑘0(𝜔), and the integration of (11) is expected to show that KK-like relation will demonstrate
its preservation. Indeed, according to Lindhard the spatial dispersion of dielectric permittivity is
given by [9]

where 𝜀𝑏is the dielectric constant due to bound electrons and 𝜔𝑝is the plasma frequency. At
𝑘= 0 the permittivity is 𝜀(𝜔, 0) = 𝜀𝑏−𝜔2
𝑝/𝜔2 and we can write for Δ𝜀(𝜔, 𝑞) = 𝜀(𝜔, 𝑞)−𝜀(𝜔, 0)

where 𝑞= 𝑘/𝑘0 = 𝑣𝐹𝑘/𝜔as shown in Fig. 6(b,c). It is evident that a KK-like relation exists
between the two parts, and the onset of LD at 𝑞= 1 is a spatial analog to the onset of band edge
absorption in temporal domain. One can interpret the spatial dispersion of the real part of the
permittivity as the change in permittivity due to "virtual" LD, i.e., virtual indirect transitions in
𝑘-space where energy and momentum conservation cannot be simultaneously satisfied. This
is illustrated by a dashed line in Fig. 6(a) where 𝑞< 1 is not sufficient to achieve LD but still
contributing to the change of real part of permittivity.

Challenges and opportunities
To assess the influence of LD on the properties of plasmonic modes, one can employ a
straightforward technique. This involves calculating the power density spectrum of the longitudinal
electric field component and subsequently determining the effective change in dielectric constant
for the entire mode
Δ𝜀eff =

(14)
Figure 6(b,c) illustrate the overlap between the mode and the LD-induced permittivity change.
As the mode’s power spectrum extends to larger wavevectors, this overlap increases. For visible
light (𝜔∼3 × 1015 s−1) in Au or Ag (𝑣𝐹∼1.4 × 106 m/s) the value of LD offset wavevector
𝑘0 ∼0.34 nm−1 is significantly larger than the mode bandwidth of
𝐹∥(𝑞)
2. Therefore, most of
the overlap occurs at large wave vectors in the tail of the
𝐹∥(𝑞)
2 only due to presence of sharp
boundary indicating that LD and nonlocality is largely surface phenomena. The impact of LD on
the real part of the permittivity is relatively limited due to sign change at 𝑞= 1 primarily resulting
in modifications to the resonant frequency, as extensively documented in the literature. In
contrast, the impact of alterations in the imaginary component of the permittivity is substantially
more pronounced. The increase in absorptive loss not only reduces field enhancement but also
influences field confinement as the field distribution tends to avoid high-loss regions.
In fact, one can evaluate the effective damping rate due to LD as

As shown in Ref. [102] one can evaluate effective LD rate as 𝛾𝑠= 3𝑣𝐹

surface to volume ratio is [102–104]:

where 𝐸2
⊥is component of the electric field normal to the surface. This confirms that LD is
a surface phenomenon. Its rate, 𝛾LD can be interpreted as the inverse of the time it takes an
average electron, moving along the electric field direction, to reach the surface. For plasmon
polaritons propagating along the metal-dielectric interface, the result 𝛾LD = 3
4𝛼𝑣𝐹where 𝛼is the
exponential decay constant inside the metal. For spherical nanoparticles of diameter 𝑎, the result
is 𝛾LD = 3
4𝑣𝐹/𝑎closely matching Kreibig’s intuitive interpretation of surface damping [105].
Given that in noble metals bulk damping is on the scale of 𝛾𝑏∼1014 s−1, it follows that LD
becomes the dominant damping process when the characteristic mode size is less than 10 nm.
The impact of LD and changes in imaginary part of permittivity is now clear. Concentrating
electric fields in SPP modes increases damping, which alters the dielectric permittivity according
to (16), affecting the mode shape and necessitating reevaluation of the damping constant. This
iterative process leads to a self-consistent solution, and the achievable field concentration
and enhancement are significantly lower than predicted by models neglecting nonlocal effects
or considering only first-order real changes in the real part of permittivity (hydrodynamic
models [37]). Notably, the mode shape is influenced both inside and outside the metal, with the
latter being crucial for applications like nonlinear optics. This is evident in various structures, such
as propagating SPPs [106], nanospheres [107], and nano-dimers [108], where field enhancement
is often desired outside the metal itself. It’s worth noting that even including the diffusion
term [65] in the hydrodynamic model of nonlocality only redistributes the field within the metal,
leaving the field outside unaffected.
Beyond its impact on field concentration and enhancement, LD absorption also plays a crucial
role in hot carrier effects in plasmonics. As absorption occurs near the metal surface and the
generated hot carriers are preferentially directed normally to the surface, it makes them more
likely to be ejected from the metal. This process underpins plasmon-assisted photodetection and
photocatalysis [102,109].
Future research and concluding remarks
While this summary has highlighted the impact of loss-induced nonlocality on the imaginary part
of the permittivity, there remain unexplored aspects of this phenomenon. One intriguing question
is how nonlocality affects absorption in the quantum regime, specifically whether the presence of
a single photon at a point 𝒓1 can influence the absorption of a second photon at another point
𝒓2. Additionally, the "reverse LD", or luminescence of metallic structures, warrants further
investigation, particularly regarding the spatial and angular distribution of emitted photons and
polaritons. It is hoped that future research will uncover more phenomena with potential practical
applications.

Landau damping of surface plasmons in metal nanoparticles: the RPA ap-
proach

metal-dielectric structures [14,65,110]. Landau damping (LD) of localized surface plasmons

===== PAGE 24 =====
(LSP) is one of the earliest manifestations of nonlocal effects observed as broadening of the LSP
resonance in optical spectra of small metal nanoparticles (NP) [105]. The optically excited LSP
decays into single-particle excitations while momentum matching is provided by the electron
scattering off the confining potential. For small NPs, this momentum relaxation mechanism can
be incorporated, along with the bulk phonon and impurity scattering, into Drude’s dielectric
function of the metal 𝜀(𝜔) = 𝜀∞−𝜔2
𝑝/𝜔(𝜔+ 𝑖𝛾), where 𝜔𝑝is the plasma frequency, and 𝛾is
the scattering rate. The latter is presented as the sum 𝛾= 𝛾0 + 𝛾𝑠of bulk scattering rate 𝛾0 and
of surface-induced rate
𝛾𝑠= 𝐴𝑣𝐹
𝐿,
(18)
where 𝑣𝐹is the electron Fermi velocity, 𝐿is NP’s characteristic size, and 𝐴is a phenomenological
constant in the range 0.3–1.5 accounting for surface-related effects [105].
Current status
The scattering rate 𝛾𝑠was initially associated with electron’s classical scattering (CS) time
𝜏cs = 𝐿/𝑣𝐹across the NP [111,112], but later it was recognized as intrinsically nonlocal effect. An
alternating electric field excites an electron-hole (e-h) pair with energy ℏ𝜔across the Fermi level
𝐸𝐹. For typical LSP energies ℏ𝜔≪𝐸𝐹, such a process requires momentum transfer 𝑞= ℏ𝜔/𝑣𝐹,
facilitated by surface scattering, which defines nonlocal length scale 𝜉= ℏ/𝑞= 𝑣𝐹/𝜔[65]. For
common plasmonic metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag), this scale is below 1 nm (e.g., for Au,
𝜉≈0.5 nm at wavelength 𝜆= 700 nm), implying that e-h pair excitation takes place in the close
proximity 𝜉to the metal surface (see Fig. 7). For a NP with characteristic size 𝐿, the probability
of such process occurring during the optical cycle is ∼𝜔𝜉/𝐿, leading to Eq. (18). Despite
subnanometer scale of 𝜉, the broadening of optical spectra associated with 𝛾𝑠has been observed
for NPs of various shapes with sizes up to ∼10 nm. In the presence of surface scattering, the
LSP resonance quality factor is 𝑄= 𝜔/𝛾≈𝑄0/[1 + (𝜉/𝐿)𝑄0], where 𝑄0 = 𝜔/𝛾0, implying that
nonlocal effects in plasmonics persist at much larger scale 𝐿∼𝜉𝑄0 ≫𝜉.

For spherical NPs in the size range transitioning from metal clusters to several nm, calculations
within jellium model using time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) highlighted
the important role of electron confining potential and electron density spillover beyond the NP
classical boundary [113,114]. At the same time, for larger NPs in the size range above several
nanometers, TDLDA calculations revealed that the precise shape of confining potential is largely
unimportant and the overall magnitude of 𝛾𝑠, defined by the coefficient 𝐴, is determined by the
electron spillover and dielectric environment effects [115, 116]. The reasonable accuracy of
Eq. (18) even for relatively large NPs indicates that, for 𝐿≫𝜉, the LD rate 𝛾𝑠can be obtained as
a correction to the Drude dielectric function within a standard analytical approach such as the
random-phase approximation (RPA) and the Lindhard dielectric function [9].
24


===== PAGE 25 =====
RPA calculations of 𝛾𝑠have been carried out in the course of several decades [102–104,117–
121]. While in earlier studies, the scattering rate for spherical NPs with radius 𝑎was derived as
𝛾sp = 3𝑣𝐹/4𝑎, the subsequent works focused on obtaining 𝛾𝑠for NPs of more complex shapes.
The major challenge was to obtain the LD rate for NPs of arbitrary shape, even irregular one,
for which no numerical calculations are feasible. The condition 𝐿≫𝜉implies that the length
scales for electronic and LSP excitations are well separated. For hard-wall confining potential,
the electronic contribution to 𝛾𝑠can be effectively "integrated out" and the LD rate is obtained as
a nonlocal correction to the Drude decay rate as 𝛾= 𝛾0 + 𝛾𝑠, where 𝛾𝑠has the form (18) with
the characteristic size 𝐿depending on the field distribution in the metal [102–104]:

(19)
Here, 𝑬is the electric field inside a NP of volume 𝑉, 𝐸𝑛is the field component normal to the NP
surface 𝑆, and 𝐴= 3/4. Importantly, 𝛾𝑠is sensitive to polarization of the LSP field that drives
the electrons towards the interface. Such form of 𝐿(and 𝛾𝑠) is valid for NPs in the size range
𝜉≪𝐿≪𝜆, where 𝜆is the optical wavelength, which includes most plasmonic systems used in
the applications.
RPA approach to Landau damping in small metal nanoparticles. Here we briefly outline
the RPA approach to LD of LSP in metal NPs following Refs. [103,104]. An external field excites
an LSP in a NP which subsequently decays into an e-h pair by promoting, with its alternating
field 𝑬𝑒−𝑖𝜔𝑡, a conduction band electron across the Fermi level, while the momentum matching
is provided by carriers’ surface scattering (see Fig. 7). The full dissipated power 𝑄in a metal NP
is given by
𝑄= 𝜔
2 Im
∫
𝑑𝑉𝑬∗· 𝑷,
(20)
where 𝑷(𝒓) is the electric polarization vector (the star stands for complex conjugation). The bulk
contribution to 𝑄is obtained by relating, in the local limit, the polarization vector to the electric
field as 𝑷(𝒓) = 𝑬(𝒓)[𝜀(𝜔) −1]/4𝜋, yielding the standard expression
𝑄= 𝜔𝜀′′(𝜔)
8𝜋
∫
𝑑𝑉|𝑬|2,
(21)
where 𝜀′′(𝜔) is the imaginary part of metal dielectric function due to bulk relaxation processes.
For small NPs, there is also a surface contribution 𝑄𝑠to the dissipated power arising from
momentum relaxation due to surface scattering. The general expression for 𝑄𝑠is obtained
by relating 𝑷(𝒓) to nonlocal electron polarization operator Π(𝜔; 𝒓, 𝒓′) via the induced charge
density 𝜌(𝒓) as
∇· 𝑷(𝒓) = −𝜌(𝒓) = −𝑒

Here, the potential Φ(𝒓) is defined as 𝑒𝑬(𝒓) = −∇Φ(𝒓), where 𝑒is the electron charge. Using

takes place in a region of size ∼𝜉≪𝐿. Then it can be shown that 𝐹(𝒔, 𝒔′) peaks in the region
|𝒔−𝒔′| ∼𝜉and rapidly oscillates outside of it. Since the electric field is relatively smooth on the
scale 𝐿, the e-h correlation function can be approximated by 𝐹(𝒔, 𝒔′) = 𝐹0 𝛿(𝒔−𝒔′), where the
coefficient 𝐹0 is evaluated using single-scattering approximation for the electron Green function
as 𝐹0 = (3𝑣𝐹𝜔2

to the Drude bulk dielectric function. The above form for 𝛿𝜀𝑠implies that the scattering rate in
the Drude dielectric function 𝜀(𝜔) should be modified as 𝛾= 𝛾0 + 𝛾𝑠. A similar expression for
𝛾𝑠was obtained in Ref. [102] using a different approach.
Although 𝛾𝑠is independent of the electric field’s overall amplitude, it is highly sensitive to
field’s polarization that defines the electrons motion relative to the metal-dielectric interface. In
the case of asymmetric NPs, such polarization dependence implies that the LD rate can vary
significantly for different LSP modes excited in the same system. This point is illustrated in Fig. 8
for longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) modes in nanorods and nanodisks, modeled by the prolate
(P) and oblate (O) spheroids, respectively. For such systems, explicit analytic expressions for the
LD rate has been obtained in the form [103] 𝛾𝑠= 𝛾sp 𝑓𝐿,𝑇, where

Here, for a prolate spheroid (nanorod), 𝛼= arccos(𝑏/𝑎), where 𝑎and 𝑏are semi-major and

same form (29) but with 𝛼= 𝑖arccosh(𝑏/𝑎). For comparison, the CS model rate 𝛾cs = 𝑣𝐹𝑆/4𝑉,
which is independent of mode polarization, is also plotted in Fig. 8. For visual convenience, all
rates are normalized by the LD rate 𝛾sp = 3𝑣𝐹/4𝑎for a spherical NP of radius 𝑎. At the sphere
point 𝑎= 𝑏, the normalized rates continuously transition into each other (e.g., PL to OL and PT
to OT), but away from it, the rates for different modes exhibit dramatic difference in magnitude
depending on the mode polarization.

Discussion and further developments
The surface scattering rate Eq. (28) quantifies LD in "simple" NPs characterized by a single
metal surface. Further developments involved more complex plasmonic systems such as thin
films [122], core-shell hybrid structures [123–125] and NP dimers [108,126]. In thin films or
metal nanoshells with dielectric core, the surface scattering that accompanies e-h pair excitation
can take place from both the inner and outer metal boundaries. The interference between these
processes can lead to coherent oscillations (quantum beats) of 𝛾𝑠with changing metal thickness
𝑑. Such oscillations were reported in TDLDA studies of thin Ag films [122] and later in RPA
calculations of 𝛾𝑠for spherical metal nanoshells [123,124]. Specifically, for metal nanoshells
with thickness 𝑑, the LD rate acquires an interference-induced contribution 𝛾int
𝑠
≈𝐵sin(𝑑/𝜉)
where the coefficient 𝐵depends on the nanoshell’s thickness and overall size [124].
In plasmonic dimers, LD has been shown to play a critical role in limiting the field enhancement
in the gap between closely spaced NPs [108,126]. Numerical calculations of the field intensity
performed within RPA using the Lindhard dielectric function [108] and within the generalized
nonlocal optical response (GNOR) model [126] revealed a significant increase in the LD rate that
reduced the field enhancement factor in the gap by nearly two orders of magnitude. Qualitatively,
the LD rate increase for narrow gaps can be inferred from the characteristic size 𝐿, given by
Eq. (19), which depends on the field distribution inside the metal. Note that, in the absence
of electron wave-function overlap between two NPs, excitation of an e-h pair can take place
in either NP, so that the LD rate for a dimer is the sum of individual NP LD rates. In dimers,
the field intensity is highest in the gap between the NPs and is much weaker in the metal,
27


===== PAGE 28 =====
where it is concentrated in a relatively small volume around the gap. More precisely, the
integrated LSP density of states (DOS) 𝜌(𝜔) can be split into contributions from the regions
inside the metal and outside of it as 𝜌(𝜔) = 𝜌in(𝜔) + 𝜌out(𝜔), with their relative magnitude
𝜌out(𝜔)/𝜌in(𝜔) = |𝜀′(𝜔)| ≫1, where 𝜀′(𝜔) is the real part of metal dielectric function [127].
With decreasing NP separation, as the LSP resonance redshifts [108,126], this ratio increases
with |𝜀′(𝜔)| implying that the electric field is further pushed out from the metal into the gap. As
a result, the volume-integrated field intensity in the numerator of Eq. (19) decreases relative to
the surface-integrated intensity in the denominator, leading to a reduced 𝐿and, hence, enhanced
LD rate for narrow gaps.
The overall magnitude of the LD rate (18) is defined by the coefficient 𝐴that depends on the
electron confining potential and charge density profile, which, in turn, determine the electric fields
near the interface. Recent TDLDA calculations for relatively large (up to 10 nm) NPs [115,116]
indicate that the main impact on the LSP resonance width comes from the electron density
spillover and dielectric environment, rather than the electronic states in the cavity. Since the
electron spillover is not sensitive to the overall NP shape, the TDLDA value 𝐴≈0.32 for a
nanosphere [115,116] is likely shape independent. Note, however, that substantially larger values
in the range 0.3–1.5 were reported in the experiment depending on the surrounding dielectric
medium [105]. On the other hand, the presence of d-band electrons with a nearly step-like density
profile in noble-metals gives rise to a thin surface layer, in which the conduction electrons with
extended density tail are no longer screened by the d-band electrons, which leads to the field
enhancement near the interface [128]. In Ag NPs, this effect has been shown to cause a blueshift
of the LSP resonance which, in fact, overcompensates the resonance redshift due to the electron
density spillover [129]. One can expect that a similar competition between these two nonlocal
mechanisms will take place for the LD rate as well and bring the coefficient 𝐴closer to the
experiment. A related effect has been recently studied for Ag NPs coated with a thin dielectric
shell [125]. In this case, the electron spillover into a medium with a much weaker field screening
results in a noticeable LD rate enhancement.
Concluding remarks
In this contribution, we tried to present a brief outlook on the Landau damping (LD) of surface
plasmons in metal nanoparticles (NPs). This phenomenon has attracted a constant interest for
over 50 years due to its prominent role in the optical spectra of small NPs. There is a very
extensive literature on LD in NPs, and several theoretical and numerical approaches have been
developed during this time span. We have focused on recent advances within the RPA approach
which resolved a long-standing problem of describing, by means of a relatively simple analytical
model, the LD of surface plasmons in metal NPs of arbitrary shape. On the applications side, LD
is an efficient source of hot electrons widely used in photochemistry and light harvesting; there
are excellent reviews on this topic the readers are referred to.

Overview
Quantum-hydrodynamic models provide a robust framework for exploring the electrodynamic
behavior of both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) electron gases, particularly in
the fields of nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. The Madelung equations, when coupled
with Poisson’s equation, allow for the analysis of magnetoplasmon spectra, magneto-optical
conductivity, and nonlocal Fermi pressure corrections, and are generally relevant for nonlinear and
28


===== PAGE 29 =====
nonlocal light-matter interactions. Applications include plasmonics [56,62,130–132], nonlinear
optics [133–136], transistor design [137], the analysis of two-dimensional materials [138–141],
and semiconductor optics [142].
The model originates from early developments in quantum mechanics, incorporating both
the statistical interpretation of the wave function and the hydrodynamic formulation. In 1926,
Born introduced the statistical interpretation of the wave function [143–145]. Shortly thereafter,
Madelung reformulated the single-particle time-dependent Schrödinger equation in hydrodynamic
form [6,146], linking quantum mechanics to some kind of fluid dynamics.
The resulting Madelung equations [6] resemble the continuity and Euler equations in fluid
dynamics but initially lacked mechanisms to account for many-body effects, such as statistical
pressure [41]. Over time, the framework was expanded to include these effects, such as Fermi
pressure and exchange-correlation terms [147]. The relationship between the hydrodynamic
model and the Schrödinger equation is bidirectional; starting from the hydrodynamic formulation,
an effective Schrödinger equation can also be derived [148–150]. This approach facilitates the
study of complex quantum systems using established numerical methods.
When studying electronic fluid dynamics under electric and magnetic fields [151–155], the self-
consistent determination of these fields becomes necessary, often requiring that the hydrodynamic
model to be solved alongside Maxwell’s equations. In particularly within plasmonics [156], the
non-retarded approximation [157] simplifies these calculations by replacing Maxwell’s equations
with Poisson’s equation, applicable under specific conditions.
The original Madelung equations, however, do not account for many-body quantum phe-
nomena [158]. This limitation can be addressed by either reformulating the approach using
a many-body wave function [158,159] or by deriving the equations from the moments of the
Wigner distribution function [148]. The latter approach naturally incorporates elements such as
statistical pressure, the Bohm term, and additional contributions from the energy potential [148],
thus extending the formalism to include many-body effects.
Madelung hydrodynamics. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by
𝑖𝜕Ψ(𝒓, 𝑡)
𝜕𝑡
= 𝐻Ψ(𝒓, 𝑡),
(30)
where 𝐻is the system’s Hamiltonian describing a particle of mass 𝑚subjected to a potential 𝑈,
and Ψ(𝒓, 𝑡) is the complex-valued wave function. By expressing the wave function as Ψ(𝒓, 𝑡) =
√︁
𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡) exp[𝑖𝑆(𝒓, 𝑡)], where 𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡) and 𝑆(𝒓, 𝑡) are real-valued functions, and substituting into
Eq. (30), two equations emerge:
𝜕𝑛
𝜕𝑡+ ∇· (𝑛𝒗) = 0,
(31a)
𝜕𝒗
𝜕𝑡+ 1
2∇𝒗2 = −1
𝑚∇𝑈+ ℏ2
2𝑚2 ∇
 1
√𝑛∇2√𝑛

.
(31b)
Here, 𝒗= ℏ∇𝑆/𝑚is the velocity field. Eq. (31a) resembles the continuity equation, while (31b)
has the form of the Euler equation for fluid motion. The term −𝑚−1∇𝑈accounts for external
forces, and the final term, known as the quantum (or Bohm) potential, arises purely from quantum
mechanics, vanishing as ℏ→0. This quantum potential introduces spatial dispersion, leading
to nonlocal effects in systems like plasmons. When 𝑈(𝒓, 𝑡) is the self-consistent electrostatic
potential 𝑉sc(𝒓, 𝑡), the system is supplemented by Poisson’s equation:
∇2𝑉sc(𝒓, 𝑡) = −𝑞
𝜖0
𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡),
(32)
where 𝑞is the particle charge and 𝜖0 is the vacuum permittivity. In cases where retardation is
significant, Maxwell’s equations replace Poisson’s equation.
29


===== PAGE 30 =====
Many-body effects. The derived Euler equation excludes many-body effects because it
originates from the single-particle Schrödinger equation. Many-body effects can be incorporated
by introducing a phenomenological term or by deriving equations from a many-body wave
function.
In many-body systems, the Euler equation acquires an additional term, the Fermi force, given
by
F𝐹= −∇𝑝𝐹[𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡)]
𝑚𝑛
,
(33)
where 𝑝𝐹is the Fermi pressure, which depends on the system’s dimensionality and particle
dispersion. For specific cases, it is given by
𝑝𝐹=


ℏ2𝑛

(3D electron gas)
𝜋ℏ2𝑛2
2𝑚,
(2D electron gas)
ℏ𝑣𝐹
3𝜋(𝜋𝑛)3/2,
(graphene)
(34)
where 𝑣𝐹is the Fermi velocity for graphene. Both the Bohm potential and the Fermi pressure
contribute to the 𝑘-dependence of the dielectric function, differing in the powers of 𝑘, i.e., 𝑘2 for
Fermi pressure and 𝑘4 for the Bohm potential.
Wigner function approach. The Madelung equations can also be derived from the Wigner
distribution function, which preserves information about both position and momentum while
maintaining the interference properties characteristic of quantum mechanics. The Wigner
distribution approach assumes a distribution function of the following form (in 2D)
𝑓(𝒓, 𝒑, 𝑡) =
1
(2𝜋)2ℏ2
∑︁
𝛼
𝑃𝛼
∫
𝑑𝒓′𝜓∗
𝛼(𝒓+ 𝒓′/2, 𝑡)𝜓𝛼(𝒓−𝒓′/2, 𝑡)𝑒𝑖𝒑·𝒓′/ℏ,
(35)
where 𝜓𝛼(𝒓, 𝑡) is a single-particle wave function obeying the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation (30). The system is assumed to be in a mixed state with a density matrix 𝜌of the form
𝜌(r, r′, 𝑡) = Í
𝛼𝑃𝛼𝜓∗
𝛼(r′, 𝑡)𝜓𝛼(r, 𝑡), where the probabilities 𝑃𝛼obey the sum rule Í𝑁𝑠
𝛼𝑃𝛼= 1,
where 𝑁𝑠is the number of states in the mixture. The time derivative of 𝑓(𝒓, 𝒑, 𝑡) can be obtained
using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (30). Introducing the following two moments of
the Wigner distribution
𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡) =
∫
𝑑𝒑𝑓(𝒓, 𝒑, 𝑡),
𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡)𝒗(𝒓, 𝑡) = 1
𝑚
∫
𝑑𝒑𝒑𝑓(𝒓, 𝒑, 𝑡),
(36)
the continuity equation arises from the first moment, while Euler’s equation arises from the
second moment, with the latter incorporating both statistical and quantum (Bohm term) pressures.
Current status
Magnetoplasmon spectrum and optical conductivity. The hydrodynamic formulation of
quantum mechanics has been effectively applied to problems such as second-harmonic generation
in 2D and 3D electron gases and the calculation of plasmon dispersion, both in the presence and
absence of a magnetic field (magnetoplasmons). Including a magnetic field in the Madelung’s
equation amounts to changing the right-hand side of Euler’s equation by including the term
−𝑞
𝑚∇𝑉−𝑞
𝑚
𝜕𝑨
𝜕𝑡+ 𝑞
𝑚𝒗× (∇× 𝑨),
(37)
where 𝑉and 𝑨are the scalar and vector potential, respectively. This does not include the Fermi
pressure, which can be incorporated in an ad hoc manner. Additionally, it is assumed that a weak
magnetic field allows for the use of the previously provided expressions for the Fermi pressure.
30


===== PAGE 31 =====
When an external electromagnetic field is introduced, the magnetic field component must be
accounted for to ensure a consistent calculation of the system’s nonlinear optical properties. With
all terms included, Euler’s equation reads
𝜕𝒗
𝜕𝑡+ (𝒗· ∇)𝒗= −𝜋ℏ
𝑚2 ∇𝑛−𝑞
𝑚∇𝑉sc + 𝑞
𝑚𝒗× 𝑩,
(38)
where 𝑉sc is the self-consistent potential. By linearizing the problem, the calculation of the
magnetoplasmon spectrum arises from the simultaneous solution of the continuity, Euler’s, and
Poisson’s equations, giving [160]
𝜔= Ω𝒌=
√︃
𝜔2𝑐+ 𝑎𝑘+ 𝛽2𝑘2.
(39)
Here, 𝑎= 𝑞2𝑛0/(2𝑚𝜖0), 𝜔𝑐= |𝑞𝐵|/𝑚is the cyclotron frequency, and 𝛽2 = 𝑣2
𝐹/2, where 𝛽
corresponds to the speed of the first sound in a 2D electron gas [161]. The previous result is valid
in the quasi-static approximation, that is, at low frequencies compared to the electron-electron
collisions rate 𝛾𝑒𝑒= (𝑘𝐵𝑇)2/(ℏ𝐸𝐹), where 𝑘𝐵, 𝑇, and 𝐸𝐹are the Boltzmann constant, the
temperature, and the Fermi energy, respectively. For the 3D electron gas we have 𝛽2 = 𝑣2
𝐹/3.
Applying an external electromagnetic field rather than a self-consistent electrostatic potential
induces a charge current 𝑱1 = 𝑞𝑛0𝒗1, which leads to the optical conductivity tensor

(40)
where 𝐷(𝒌, 𝜔) = 𝑞2𝐵2 + 𝑚2𝛽2𝑘2 −𝑚2𝜔2. When nonlocal corrections are neglected [162], this
result agrees with calculations based on Boltzmann’s kinetic equation (see also Refs. [163,164]).
Nonlinear effects. We can extend the formalism for the calculation of nonlinear optical
properties of the electron gas [165–167]. Up to second order, the nonlinear current is defined
as 𝑱NL = 𝑞𝑛0𝒗2 + 𝑞𝑛1𝒗1, where 𝒗2 is the new term resulting from the expansion of the velocity
field up to second order. Proceeding as in linear response, and assuming a zero static magnetic
field, we find that

(41)
This result agrees with the literature [168,169] and where we have used that 𝑞= −𝑒< 0, with 𝑒
being the elementary charge. We emphasize that 𝑬𝜔(𝒓) corresponds to the total field and not to
the external field. Note that we have assumed that the total electric field has a finite in-plane
momentum component 𝑘𝑥. For normal incidence, 𝑘𝑥= 0 and the second order response vanishes,
as it should according to inversion-symmetry arguments.
Plasmon-enhanced second-harmonic generation. The calculation of second-harmonic
generation assisted by plasmons [170] can be performed by including a potential of the form
𝑉ext +𝑉ind in Euler’s equation, where 𝑉ext corresponds to the external potential and 𝑉ind represents
the induced potential from plasmon excitation, which is accounted for via Poisson’s equation.
Proceeding in the same manner as for the determination of the magnetoplasmon spectrum, we
find, including nonlocal corrections, that [171]

The longitudinal excitations of the gas are determined from ˆ𝜖(𝒌, 𝜔) = 0, implying the spectrum
𝜔(𝑘) =

𝑘+ 𝛽2𝑘2. Therefore, the SHG is enhanced by plasmon excitation.
As opposed to the case studied previously for zero magnetic field, where nonlocal corrections
were ignored, the finite value of 𝜙ind
2𝜔requires a finite in-plane wave vector.
In Fig. 9 we depict the function 𝜙ind
2𝜔as function of the plasmons wave number and energy ℏ𝜔.
The two harmonics are clearly visible, whose dispersion follows the plasmon curve of the 2D
electron gas.
Challenges and opportunities
The primary advantage of the hydrodynamic model lies in its simplicity compared to other
methods that incorporate quantum mechanical effects. This simplicity proves advantageous in
two distinct contexts: i) deriving straightforward analytical results for relevant problems and
ii) numerically solving complex systems where the hydrodynamic model effectively captures
quantum effects. Below, we briefly discuss how these features can motivate the application of the
hydrodynamic model to recent and intriguing problems.
First, the connection between the hydrodynamic and Schrödinger equations, as demonstrated
in the previous section, enables their parallel use alongside Maxwell’s or Poisson’s equations.
This approach has been previously explored to study electron spill-out [150], but could be further
applied to various plasmonic problems using numerical methods from quantum mechanics.
The Wigner transformation has been applied in the context of nanoscale electronic trans-
port [172], with the possibility of incorporating electron-phonon [173] and electron-impurity
interactions [174]. Similar approaches could be employed to incorporate the effects of phonons
and impurities in the hydrodynamic model, aiding in the understanding of their role in plas-
mon propagation, spectral broadening, and plasmon-phonon hybridization. Furthermore, the
32


===== PAGE 33 =====
hydrodynamic equation can account for viscosity [175,176].
As nanoparticle size decreases, light-matter interactions deviate from their bulk counterparts
due to quantum confinement [177]. The hydrodynamic model can incorporate quantum effects,
such as the Fermi pressure term, while remaining compatible with most numerical approaches in
nano-optics, such as the finite-element method [56]. Thus, the hydrodynamical equation can be
used to investigate the plasmonic properties of nanostructures, including novel 2D van der Waals
materials.
Although this study focused on second-harmonic generation in graphene, the procedure can be
extended to higher-order nonlinear responses, such as third-harmonic generation [92], four-wave
mixing [178], plasmon self-modulation [179], and solitons [180]. In the case of self-modulation
phenomena driven by nonlinearity, we expect a renormalization of the plasmon dispersion and
an amplification of nonlocal effects due to nonlinearity. Using the hydrodynamic formalism,
an analytic expression for the renormalized spectra can, in principle, be derived. Furthermore,
rather than analyzing the Fourier decomposition of the fields for each order, one could first solve
the hydrodynamic equations in the time domain and subsequently decompose the fields in the
frequency domain.
This work considered the Schrödinger Hamiltonian corresponding to a Fermi liquid described
by an effective mass Hamiltonian. However, in the realm of quantum materials, ranging from
graphene to topological insulators [181], one can expect phenomena such as flat bands, strongly
correlated systems, and nontrivial Bloch curvature. Other material excitations, like excitons,
phonons, and Cooper pairs, strongly couple with light [182]. A relevant question, then, is whether
a hydrodynamic model akin to the one presented here can be developed for these excitations.
Future developments to address challenges
Generalizations of the quantum hydrodynamic model to address light-matter interactions in
anisotropic systems, such as phosphorene, and strongly correlated systems, such as magnetic
systems, are urgently needed. Finally, a formulation based on the Wigner distribution is a possible
development to address the mentioned challenges.
Developing models that go beyond the hydrodynamic model while retaining similar simplicity
is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. One such relevant problem is the study of plasmons in
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, which exhibits flat bands [183,184].
Concluding remarks
The quantum-hydrodynamic framework, derived from the Madelung equations, has evolved
into a versatile tool for analyzing nonlocal and nonlinear effects in photonic materials. Its
capability to incorporate many-body interactions, magnetic fields, and self-consistent electrostatic
potentials enables rich insights into electron dynamics. By bridging quantum mechanics and
hydrodynamics, this approach paves the way for advancing applications of advanced materials.

Continuum framework for plasmonic systems
GINO WEGNER
& KURT BUSCH
Current status
The continuum framework for plasmonic systems deals with the underlying many-body dynamics
while, at the same time, embracing only a small set of degrees of freedom, thereby providing
access to a large class of analytically and numerically tractable observables. This approach is
particularly suited to handle the collective conduction electron dynamics, i.e. the protagonists of
33


===== PAGE 34 =====
plasmonic excitations. In fact, besides bare plasmons, these plasmon excitations also include
hybrid light-plasmon excitations commonly referred to as plasmon polaritons. While plasmons
occur both, in the bulk and near surfaces, the finite penetration depth of electromagnetic fields
in metals confines plasmon polaritons to surfaces (surface plasmon polaritons, SPPs) or small
nano-particles (localized surface plasmon polaritons, LSPs). Over the past few decades, these
plasmonic excitations have been studied extensively both, theoretically and experimentally, and
find numerous applications in nano-photonic devices and plasmon-driven chemistry.
The continuum framework rests on local averaging schemes (in the multi-scale modeling also
known as coarse-graining), which yield balance equations for the bulk of the form
𝜕𝑡F (𝛼) (𝒓, 𝑡) = −∇· F (𝛼+1) (𝒓, 𝑡) + S(𝛼) (𝒓, 𝑡),
(44)
thereby connecting consecutive-order moments F (𝛼) of increasing tensorial rank while intro-
ducing different source/sink terms S(𝛼). Here, a position 𝒓specifies a volume element 𝑑𝑉
which is small compared to the whole continuum, but large compared to the typical distance
of constituents [185]. Contemporary bulk models in plasmonics describe the dynamics of the
charge density 𝜌, which, in the absence of external electromagnetic fields, is assumed to be
spatially homogeneous. In turn, the charge density is coupled to the current density 𝑱by the
continuity equation [11]
𝜕𝑡𝜌(𝒓, 𝑡) = −∇· 𝑱(𝒓, 𝑡) .
(45)
Similarly, the current balance reads
𝜕𝑡𝑱(𝒓, 𝑡) = −∇· Π(𝒓, 𝑡) + S(1) (𝒓, 𝑡) ,
(46)
and is tied to momentum balance by the ubiquitous relation 𝑱= (𝜌/𝑚) 𝒑where 𝒑denotes the
momentum.
Different continuum models differ in the form of Π which, in linear response, describes
the stress tensor [185] and is typically split into pressure- and shear-like contributions, i.e.
Π = Π
p + Π
sh. The stress tensor describes locally the macroscopic response due to short-ranged
(classical and quantum) interactions induced by deformations of the continuum [186] [see
Fig. 10(a,b)]. In practice, it is often expressed by equations of state [187] via 𝜌and/or 𝑱–
introducing nonlocality which originates in the conduction electron’s Fermi–Dirac statistics and
scales with the Fermi velocity 𝑣𝐹. In the Drude model [43], the charge density is assumed to be
incompressible and constant Π ≡0 and the current sink/source is given by a phenomenological
damping term via a relaxation rate 𝛾and an external field, which adds to the internal Coulomb
field. The ionic background is treated as a rigid continuum for overall charge-neutrality and a
restoring force [24]. As a general feature, the Drude model allows for the existence of plasmons,
SPPs, LSPs and non-radiative dissipation. Within the Euler–Drude model [46] (i.e., the linearized
version of the HDM discussed in Sec. 3 of this Roadmap) attributed to Bloch [7], the Drude model
is augmented by a hydrostatic pressure term, such that ∇· Π

√
3 is
the characteristic velocity of compressional waves. When combined with hard-wall boundary
conditions, this model is known to qualitatively reproduce the size-dependent nonlocal blueshift
of LSPs in noble metals. In fact, the hard-wall boundary condition prohibits the spill-out of the
charge density which is implied by the large values of these systems’ work function [16] (see also
Sec. 3 of this Roadmap). Further, the viscoelastic model [175] introduces shear. It interpolates
between the viscous shear at small frequencies of the incident field compared to the rate 𝛾and
non-dissipative elastic shear [186] at large frequencies. The dissipative nature of the former
limit [185,188] [corresponding to a Navier–Stokes(–Drude) model] is tied to a damping of the
internal stresses on the time scale ∼1/𝛾. The viscoelastic shear stress is reminiscent of highly

together with the pressure embodies longitudinal nonlocality.
As a last model, we introduce a contribution due to Halevi [45], which describes the longitudinal
projection ( ˆL) of the viscoelastic model. As such, the nonlocal correction for plasmonic

of pressure and shear [46] (see also Sec. 3 of this Roadmap). It increases the expected LSP
blueshifts. In fact, the Halevi model gives rise to a unified (qualitative) description of line
shifts and broadenings of LSPs in noble metals [46]. In Fig. 10(c), we illustrate the hierarchical
interrelation in Fourier space of the above-described bulk continuum models along with the
correspondingly added dynamics and concomittant effects on LSPs. We emphasize, that only
two bulk parameters, 𝜔𝑝and 𝛾, have to be determined (e.g. via fits to experimental refractive
indices that exclude surface effects [16,46,191]). Specifically, the Fermi velocity represents a
third parameter which occurs in those models that feature a stress tensor and it can be derived
from the metal’s equilibrium electron density 𝑛0, using 𝜔𝑝= 𝜔𝑝(𝑛0).

Besides a bulk material description, a complete material model for plasmonic scatterers
requires an appropriate treatment of the surface. In the simplest case, a description of the metal
by a local bulk response (e.g. Drude) is carried all the way up to a discontinuous transition to
a dielectric environment with spatially-constant bulk response (which includes vacuum) [16]
leading to a sharp boundary. A more general framework is based on a treatment of Maxwell’s
equations and the introduction of a sub-wavelength transition layer (also called selvedge [192]).
This layer’s response deviates from that of the corresponding bulk medium [193]. In the spirit
of continuum models, the charges, currents and fields in this microscopic surface layer are
35


===== PAGE 36 =====
integrated out (in surface-normal direction) to yield surface excess quantities. These govern the
(dis)continuities of the bulk fields at material interfaces [193], thereby leading to corrections of
the treatment of sharp boundaries above. The (dis)continuities represent a formal set of boundary
conditions including, as special cases, the classical Maxwell [11] as well as the mesoscopic
boundary conditions discussed in Secs. 3 and 13 of this Roadmap. In principle, these excesses
can be derived from the charges and currents induced in the surface layer of a scatterer with
nonlocal continuum bulk models, assuming the latter to be equipped with additional boundary
conditions (ABCs) [19]. In particular, the surface charges and currents using nonlocal continuum
models can then be used to derive surface-response functions (e.g., Feibelman parameters [194]),
for use in the new boundary conditions (such as, e.g., in the mesoscopic treatment as displayed
in Ref. [16]). In such scattering problems, the lower bound of resolved bulk scales is lifted, such,
that typically a local description of the metal’s bulk is used. This scheme is analytically more
tractable and simplifies time-domain simulations [16], while allowing for a successively more
elaborate surface-treatment via continuum-derived excesses (see e.g. the Euler–Drude-derived
Feibelman parameter listed in Ref. [16]). In turn, the latter would enrich the desired database
of Feibelman parameters, discussed in Sec. 13 of this Roadmap. We would like to stress, that
the reduction to a local bulk model removes confined bulk plasmons, e.g. the standing waves in
spheres employing the Euler–Drude model [195].
Challenges and opportunities
Naturally, with increasing complexity of a continuum model and/or scatterer geometry, the
underlying set of differential equations (completed with initial and boundary conditions) may
not anymore be amenable for analytical treatment so that numerical Maxwell solvers have to be
employed. In this context, discontinuous-Galerkin finite-element methods represent a natural
choice as they are tailored for the spatial discretization of balance equations in the presence
of material interfaces. In a nodal discontinuous-Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) approach
to Maxwell’s equations [196, 197], the electromagnetic and matter fields are discretized on
unstructured finite-element meshes for adaptive discretization of complex geometries, equipped
with element-local interpolating nodal basis functions of adjustable order for efficient sampling
of the relevant bulk length scales. In order to obtain a global solution, the fields in neighboring
elements are connected via numerical fluxes which facilitates a flexible incorporation of boundary
conditions. The spatial discretization leads to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations in
time which, owing to the element-local discretization, can be solved with high-order explicit
time-stepping schemes (e.g. low-storage Runge–Kutta schemes) that allow to take full advantage
of the efficient spatial discretization. Besides pulsed plane-wave excitations (e.g. for computing
spectra and field distributions via on-the-fly Fourier transforms [46, 198, 199]), the DGTD
approach has been extended to point-dipole sources (which allow, among others, to compute
Green’s tensors, e.g. for Casimir–Polder calculations [200]) and electron beams (for determing
energy-electron loss and cathodoluminescence spectra [201–203]). In addition, the numerical
scheme allows the treatment of cavities and open systems as well [197].
On the analytical level, a number of Mie solutions with successively refined continuum bulk
models exist [16,46,190,204,205]. In fact, with increasing order of the spatial derivatives in
Eq. (46) more field modes appear (satisfying separate Helmholtz equations [190]) each with
its own wavenumbers 𝑘via the implicit longitudinal and transverse dispersion relations [206],
𝜀L(𝑘L, 𝜔) = 0 and 𝑘2
T = 𝜀T(𝑘T, 𝜔)𝜔2/𝑐2
0, that result from the corresponding models’ longitudinal
and transverse nonlocal dielectric functions 𝜀L and 𝜀T. With an increasing number of modes, the
problem becomes analytically intractable. Independent of this and since the particular choice
of ABCs significantly impacts the interplay of these modes, it is highly desirable to develop a
general framework to derive ABCs for nonlocal continuum models (beyond typical hard-wall [16]
and no-slip conditions [207]).
36


===== PAGE 37 =====
Future developments to address challenges
In order to discuss future developments of the continuum framework for plasmonic systems it is,
again, instructive to distinguish analytical and numerical pathways.
In the analytical realm, the focus lies on a systematic refinement of the bulk models, where
connections to kinetic equations for the statistical dynamics in phase-space have been suggested [46,
175,187,189] and relations to orbital-free approximations of dynamical equations appearing in
TDDFT have been pointed out [208]. Eventually the refined bulk models should also consider
the influence of the Fermi–Dirac statistics on electron-electron interaction. As an early precursor,
we would like to mention the incorporation of the Dirac exchange term in Eq. (46) [209] as a
function of the density gradient. When keeping same-spin electrons apart, this term counteracts
the hydrostatic pressure, thereby reducing the LSP lineshifts in noble metals. However, since this
respresents an extension of the dynamical equation suggested by Bloch, the need for modifications
towards plasmonic frequencies still has to be discussed. Moving beyond noble metals, refined
bulk models should address the modifications to the Drude model that are required to accurately
describe transition metals [210]. While all the above treatments of the bulk refer to the conduction
electrons, a complete model of the optical response of metals also necessitates the (on the linear
level additive [211,212]) incorporation of the response of bound electrons due to the significant
absorption stemming from interband transitions (IBTs) as well as due to the (often d-band)
screening of the conduction electrons away from the IBT range [213] using few parameters with
clear physical meaning [191].
Regarding the surface response, derivations of Feibelman parameters based on TDDFT-
informed continuum bulk models would be very interesting, since eventually Feibelman parameters
are often determined from or checked against TDDFT simulations (see Secs. 12 and 13 of this
Roadmap). Further, this would allow the separation of the approximations that are tied to bulk
continuum models from those that are tied to use of Feibelman parameters. Further, we suggest
to examine the applicability of the excess formalism also to balance equations beyond the level of
charge conservation. This will allow the connection to the bulk nonlocal response and should
lead to a generalized set of ABCs. Specifically, assuming a planar surface in the 𝑥𝑦-plane, the
continuity equation has led to the general result [193]
𝐽n(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧→0−) −𝐽n(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧→0+) = 𝜕𝑡𝜌s(𝑥, 𝑦) + ∇∥· 𝑱s,∥(𝑥, 𝑦)
(48)
where ∇∥= (𝜕𝑥, 𝜕𝑦, 0) is the gradient with surface-parallel components only and the subscript s
denotes an excess.
In the numerical realm, the focus lies on the implementation of the analytical forms of the
above-discussed bulk and surface response. On the bulk level, for DGTD a particular difficulty
emerges with higher-order spatial derivatives related to the stress tensor such as when introducing
the von Weizsäcker potential [214]. As a time-domain formulation, the DGTD allows to treat
also nonlinear response. So far, the convective nonlinearity [185] of the full Euler–Drude model
has been treated and this could serve as a starting point for similar developments regarding
more refined models. The geometrical flexibility inherent in finite-element approaches such as
boundary-element methods (see Sec. 13 of this Roadmap) or DGTD should further be leveraged
by considering different boundary conditions in order to reflect on the subtleties of the transition
layer also for irregular shapes, including e.g. surface roughness. Here we stress, that some
surface-response functions such as the Feibelman parameters obtained from the Euler–Drude
model with hard-wall boundary conditions [16], are usually derived in frequency domain.
Consequently, their inclusion in boundary-element methods is quite advanced (see Sec. 13 of this
Roadmap) but, so far, is largely absent for DGTD.
As regards the analytical and numerical studies as well, modern plasmonic studies are also
focused on the interaction with external resonances, e.g. in core-shell particles, where excitons
of dye-shells (like J-aggregate layers) couple to the plasmons in the metallic core. While aiming
37


===== PAGE 38 =====
for more realistic descriptions, it has been realized that the choice of model for each bulk
material determines the nature and also amount of resonances of the core-shell system (see, e.g.,
Ref. [215]). We also suggest to explore the role of metallic bulk nonlocality and surface roughness
on the matching of plasmonic and excitonic resonance as well as the losses, determining wether
strong coupling prevails. Further, the applicability of continuum bulk models in other materials,
such as doped semiconductors [216] or meta-materials, has to be studied, similar to the suggestion
on such attempts for surface response functions in Sec. 12 of this Roadmap.
Concluding remarks
Overall, the continuum framework for plasmonic systems provides an efficient and extensible
description of the collective dynamics of conduction electrons. Depending on the resolved scales
and, thus, accuracy, either nonlocal bulk models are matched with additional boundary conditions
or local models are equipped with mesoscopic boundary conditions, which can be derived from
the charges and currents originating in the former case. The established plasmonic continuum
models have demonstrated the necessity to distinguish between longitudinal and transverse bulk
nonlocality, with analytical solutions being available for selected combinations of material models
and geometries. To increase the class of tractable material models and geometries the DGTD has
proven itself as a flexible and resource-efficient Maxwell solver.

Overview
Optical spatial nonlocality, a spatially dispersive effect where local polarization depends on
nearby fields, is an omnipresent phenomenon in natural materials. In fact, beyond the temporal
nonlocality that leads to the well-known frequency dispersion, spatial dispersion depending
on the momentum is often neglected in conventional photonics involving bulk materials. This
effect is instead very relevant in the context of nanophotonics, especially plasmonics, where
light can be concentrated into a deep-subwavelength region. In this case, the near field of the
light can resolve the medium’s microscopic spatial graininess, which violates the conception
of homogeneous constitutive parameters in the bulk materials with an averaged field. Once the
scale of light-matter interaction is confined down to nanometer-scale, quantum effects play a
dominant role and the dielectric constant becomes nonlocal.
Current status
The Kohn–Sham (KS) density-functional theory (DFT) approach and its time-dependent extension
(TD-DFT) is a powerful method for accurately describing quantum effects [217] (see also Sec. 9
of this Roadmap). However, its computational cost is prohibitively high for mesoscopic plasmonic
nanostructures containing billions of electrons. Such systems are predominantly governed by the
collective behavior of electrons rather than individual single-particle properties, allowing for a
trade-off between accuracy and the computational demand of calculating each electron’s orbital.
Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) methods [208,218,219], which approximate the
kinetic energy functional by assuming an effective orbital, provide an efficient alternative for
addressing these large-scale systems. They are less accurate but much faster than KS methods.
Building on this principle, the quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) [61,62,131,208] provides
a self-consistent framework that incorporates microscopic quantum effects–such as nonlocality,
electron spill out, and quantum tunneling–while seamlessly integrating with full-vector Maxwell’s
38

equations. This approach effectively predict both near- and far-field properties of mesoscopic
systems. It borrows the concept of electron density 𝑛(r, 𝑡) from DFT, together with another
macroscopic variable – the electron fluid velocity 𝑣(r, 𝑡), enabling the dynamics of the electron
fluid to be expressed as:

where all quantum effects are collected into the functional 𝐺[𝑛]. The functional 𝐺[𝑛] can be

i.e. as the sum of non-interacting kinetic energy, 𝑇[𝑛], and exchange-correlation potential

functionals 𝐺[𝑛] are neglected, in the linear regime Eq. (49) will reduce to the Drude model, i.e.,
local-response approximation (LRA), as shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11. A summary of three different response models of a free-electron gas. In
the local-response model, the induced charge density is a Dirac delta function on the
metal surface. The background equilibrium density 𝑛0 is uniform and confined in the
ion boundary; in the Thomas–Fermi hydrodynamic theory (TF-HT), 𝑛0 is uniform as
local-response model while the induced electrons accumulate near the metal surface
without being able to escape (hard-wall condition); in the quantum hydrodynamic
theory (QHT) the equilibrium density is exponentially decaying across the metal surface
and the induced charges are smeared both inside and outside the metal-air interface.
Different functionals used are summarized as below.
The Fermi theory of a free-electron gas introduces electron-electron interactions leading to a
collective repulsion of electrons due to the Pauli exclusion principle. As a result, when electrons
are forced toward the material boundary by an external electric field, they spread (see the induced
density 𝑛1 of middle panel of Fig. 11). This approximation, denoted as 𝐺[𝑛] = 𝑇TF[𝑛], is referred
to as Thomas–Fermi hydrodynamic theory (TF-HT). To properly describe the boundary behavior,
additional conditions–so-called hard-wall boundary condition (HW-BC)–must be imposed,
ensuring that the normal component of the polarization vanishes. Physically, the HW-BC imply
that electrons cannot cross the boundary. TF-HT has been shown to successfully account account
for the blueshift of plasmonic resonances and the decrease of the field enhancement in confined
regions [56,84].
The TF-HT framework is not always accurate because it often considers the background
equilibrium density (𝑛0) to be constant and strictly confined within the material boundaries,
neglecting the quantum effects such as electron spill out and tunneling. To address these
limitations QHT [61,62,131] incorporates a more advanced KE approximation by employing a
fraction (𝜆) of the von Weizsäcker (vW) kinetic energy functional, namely
𝑇[𝑛] = 𝑇TF[𝑛] + 𝜆𝑇vW[𝑛]
(51)
39


===== PAGE 40 =====
together with the exchange-correlation with local-density approximations (LDA). We note
that XC functionals beyond LDA can also be employed. However, given the approximations
inherent in the leading term–the kinetic energy (KE) functional–it is not particularly beneficial
to use more sophisticated XC functionals in this context. The KE functional in Eq. (51) is
also widely used for ground-state calculations of finite systems within OF-DFT. The OF-DFT
ground-state calculation in the jellium model is equivalent to solve the zero-order equation on
the QHT, which can be easily coupled to the Poisson’s equation to account for the electrostatic
potentials [220]. Additionally, the near-field potential from the ionic lattice and the electron
affinity of the interfacing dielectric become relevant when considering electron spill-out and
its tunability at the interface between, for example, a noble metal and a dielectric [221]. Thus
the spatially-varying equilibrium electron density 𝑛0(𝒓) can be calculated [Fig. 11(right)), for
metallic structures of any shape. Structures such as dimers and other nanogap configurations
exhibiting electronic quantum tunneling effects can be accurately modeled using this framework,
eliminating the need for additional boundary conditions. More precisely, in the context of
QHT, the concept of well-defined boundary conditions, such as HW-BC of TF-HT, is no longer
applicable since electrons can cross boundaries and decay in space, resulting in continuous fields
throughout the system. However, realistic simulations require the physical domain to have finite
dimensions, and the choice and truncation of the simulation region might significantly influence
the accuracy of the results. Greater accuracy and stability in QHT can be achieved by improving
the KE functional, incorporating for example Laplacian-level kinetic energy contributions [132].
Moreover, numerical schemes for modeling the nonlinear optical response of QHT have been
proposed [222], along with efficient simulation approaches that can handle full three-dimensional
systems [223].
Opportunities and Challenges
QHT is a versatile multiscale numerical tool well-suited for a broad range of applications in
systems that require quantum-mechanical modeling of electrons alongside the ability to account
for macroscopic optical interactions.
Applicability beyond metals. In recent decades, QHT has been successfully applied to
describe optical properties of alkali, e.g., sodium (Na), and noble metals, e.g., gold (Au) and
silver (Ag) [221]. The study of alkali metals holds fundamental significance as it validates
QHT by benchmarking its predictions against DFT calculations. On the other hand, research
on noble metals has its practical relevance as these materials are the most used in conventional
plasmonic applications. However, extending the application of QHT to other material systems has
been limited. More recently, significant efforts have focused on exploring alternative materials
that support plasmons, including degenerate electron systems such as transparent conduction
oxides (TCO), e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO) in the near-infrared, graphene, and heavily doped
semiconductors, e.g., indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), in the
mid-infrared. These materials exhibit exceptional linear and nonlinear optical properties, as well
as electrical tunability. TF-HT has been employed to characterize the linear and nonlinear optical
responses of ITO [224] and doped semiconductors [225]. Intersubband transitions in heavily
doped semiconductor systems, or metallic quantum wells (QWs), present particularly intriguing
phenomena since their properties can be tuned externally, and they exhibit exceptionally strong
optical nonlinearities [226]. When doping levels are sufficiently high, such that the Fermi
level can cover the conduction band and a few QW states, the intersubband transitions become
plasmonic since the potential has a much lower contribution to the Hamiltonian. Organized
into nanometer-scale layers, these heavily doped semiconductor or metallic QWs can support
remarkably strong optical nonlinearities [227,228]. Conventionally, QW properties are solved
using Schrödinger-Poisson equations [229] and other phenomenological models [230], but their
nonlinear susceptibilities remain complex to predict. Preliminary work based on TF-HT has
40


===== PAGE 41 =====
been undertaken to address the strong nonlinearity of such QWs [231]. However, more precise
predictions of QHT applied to these and other emerging material systems remains a promising
yet largely unexplored avenue for future research.
Nonlinear nano-optics empowered by QHT. Among the various applications of QHT, those
focused on nonlinear phenomena are particularly compelling. Contrarily to effective-response
approaches, such as the use of Feibelman 𝑑-parameters [194] (see also Secs. 12 and 13 of this
Roadmap), or quantum-corrected methods [79,232], which are often restricted to linear response
regimes, QHT inherently provides a comprehensive, fully dynamical framework. Moreover, while
nonlocal and electron spill-out effects are traditionally regarded as "unwanted" side effects that
increase broadening and degrade field enhancement, from a nonlinear perspective, these effects
can instead enhance the free-electron response [233]. Low-electron-density Drude materials such
as TCOs, and heavily doped semiconductors can indeed support high optical nonlinearity, as
their effective nonlinear susceptibilities scale inversely with some power (depending on the order)
of the electron density [225] as well as their effective electron mass [234]. Although TF-HT has
been successfully applied to describe heavily doped semiconductors [235], ITO [224], and silicon
(Si), these approaches rely on the assumption that spill-out effects can be neglected. By contrast,
QHT –accounting for spatially varying equilibrium electron densities–becomes particularly
relevant for configurations where geometry dimensions are comparable with the typical scale of
electron spill-out. Examples include QWs and atomic scale protrusions supporting extremely
localized optical modes (see Sec. 10 in this Roadmap). Additionally, the local spatially varying
electron density can indeed have a significant impact either directly on the nonlinear optical
properties [233,236] or on the linear response in a nonlinear manner through externally controlled
𝑛0 [237,238]. A self-consistent QHT proves very suitable for both scenarios.
Longitudinal bulk plasmons. A longitudinal bulk plasmon (LBP) is an electronic density
wave within the bulk material, enabled by nonlocal effects in the medium’s constitutive relations.
LBPs have been extensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally, for decades in
free-electron gas materials with TF-HT [52,206,216,239,240]. Yet, their application scenarios
remain largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges associated with efficiently exciting
them in conventionally sized structures. Recent advances in material science and nanofabrication
have however have begun to unlock new possibilities. Unlike localized surface plasmons, which
occur at the material boundaries at lower energy, LBPs resonate above the plasma frequency
in the bulk region of the material. This distinction leads to unique opportunities: Firstly, the
resonance of LBPs lies above the plasma frequency, which correspond to the epsilon-near-zero
(ENZ) region commonly associated with TCOs. This allows LBPs in TCOs to possibly operate
in the near-infrared or even visible spectrum, hereby providing a valuable complement to silicon
photonics. Secondly, since the LBP optical mode profile reaches into the bulk regions, they
offer larger active interaction volumes compared to surface-bound modes. This larger volume
enables higher nonlinear efficiencies. Recent studies using TF-HT have revealed that LBPs in
plasmon-QW hybrid structures can exhibit exceptionally high Kerr nonlinearities and low-power-
threshold optical bistability [231]. Looking forward, the application of QHT is expected to unveil
new physics in this domain. By incorporating a more accurate description of spatially varying
electron densities and dynamical responses, QHT can provide deeper insights into LBP behavior
and open pathways for innovative applications in nonlinear and quantum photonics.
QHT as a constitutive description of nonlocal media. QHT couples with Maxwell’s
equations to form a closed description for plasmonic responses, it effectively serves as a
constitutive relation of spatially dispersive metals and semiconductors. Building upon the
full-wave solution obtained by solving the coupled Maxwell-QHT equations, a more formal and
comprehensive electromagnetic theory for nonlocal media emerges. This theory, grounded in
QHT, is particularly useful for analyzing the optical responses and bridging gaps with other models.
Notably, QHT, as a continuum theory, has recently been integrated into the generalized Lorentz
41


===== PAGE 42 =====
model (GLM) [241]. Within the theoretical framework of GLM electromagnetic theorems such
as Poynting theorem and Lorentz reciprocity are generalized to nonlocal media. This extension
further enables the development of a QHT-based quasinormal mode (QNM) theory (see Sec. 10
of this Roadmap). The QNM theory not only provides modal analysis, as evidenced with the
classical QNM theory, it promises a route to field quantization through the QNM expansion of
Green’s function [242]. The elevation of QHT to a quantized theory is yet still an unaccomplished
feat.
Future developments to address challenges
While QHT can incorporate functionals to capture both linear and nonlinear optical properties of
degenerate electron systems, there remain considerable challenges to be solved.
Full self-consistency. Due to the mathematical complexity of QHT equations, these are often
solved using a perturbation approach where the equilibrium (ground-state) electron density 𝑛0 is
calculated independently by solving the zeroth-order equation [220]. Then, one assumes that the
sum of all higher-order perturbations remains much smaller than 𝑛0. However, this assumption
becomes less straightforward near boundaries, where 𝑛0 exhibits exponential decay, where a
different asymptotic decay velocity might render this condition false for any arbitrary small
perturbation. In the context of quantum systems, one must ensure that 𝑛= 𝑛0 + 𝛿𝑛> 0, while
this is straightforward when 𝛿𝑛> 0 it might be problematic when 𝛿𝑛< 0. From a foundational
perspective, this highlights the need for a time-dependent, fully self-consistent model to address
QHT and eliminate the perturbative shortcomings [243,244]. A non-perturbative, time-dependent
treatment would account for saturation effects and allow for the full exploration of plasmon
dynamics, including modulation effects driven by changes in 𝑛0.
Accuracy of QHT. The accuracy of QHT is strongly influenced by the choice of KE functionals,
far more so than by than the exchange-correlation energy. A detailed discussion on the subject
can be found in Ref. [208]. Two main pathways for enhancement can be identified:
The first approach involves better capturing the nonlocality of the KE functional. In the TF-HT
framework the KE functional is entirely local, although the use of Eq. (51) introduces a semilocal
description. Laplacian-level (LL) KE functionals, such as those described in Ref. [132], further
increase nonlocality, but they also introduces significant complexity in practical implementations.
This is particularly problematic for nonlinear applications, where expansions in LL-QHT become
quite cumbersome. In solid-state physics, fully nonlocal KE functionals based on the Lindhard
function [9], which describes the exact response of the homogeneous electron gas, have been
extensively studied [218,219]. Unlike LL-KE functionals, these nonlocal functionals are not
derived from high-order derivatives of the electron density but instead use convolutions of
the electron density with the Lindhard function. These nonlocal KE functionals are, however,
typically defined in the reciprocal space and thus limited to periodic systems and/or finite systems
inside a periodic cell. For applications in nano-optics, where far-field scattering calculations are
of interest, KE functionals must be defined in the real-space. Recently, fully nonlocal functionals
in real-space have emerged [245]. These functionals involve the calculation of the screened
Coulomb potential and its functional derivatives, which can be implemented within the QHT
framework for nano-optics. Thus, such functionals can represent an interesting direction to follow
to increase the QHT accuracy for diverse systems.
The second pathway is to address the frequency dependence–or non-adiabaticity–of the KE
functional, as the exact 𝐺[𝑛] functional also depends on time. In the frequency-domain, using
Eq. (51), the KE contributions to the QHT are static and real-valued. However, the exact
KE contributions are frequency-dependent and complex-valued [208], with the imaginary part
accounting for the broadening [220]. This issue have been discussed in Refs. [246–248]. For
just two electrons, the (static) vW KE functional is exact and the QHT linear response exactly
coincides with the reference TD-DFT results [208]. For many electron systems, a frequency
42


===== PAGE 43 =====
dependent KE is required [248]. However, to date only nonlocal approximations derived from the
Lindhard function exists [246–249], which cannot be directly applied for real-space nano-optics
QHT implementation. Finding a spatially nonlocal and frequency-dependent KE functional in
real-space is a challenging interesting direction for future developments.
For both the above development directions machine-learning can be a valuable tool [250–253].
Concluding Remarks
QHT is a rapidly evolving and versatile tool for modeling quantum effects in nanophotonics. By
incorporating quantum corrections into macroscopic optical models, QHT enables the accurate
prediction of both linear and nonlinear optical responses, bridging the gap between quantum
mechanics and classical electrodynamics. Despite its successes, significant challenges remain,
particularly in expanding its applicability to nonlinear and more complex systems.
Future advancements in QHT hinge on two critical fronts: the development of more accurate
and versatile KE functionals and the adoption of fully self-consistent, time-dependent numerical
solvers. Addressing the nonlocality of KE functionals will be essential for extending QHT’s
utility to a broader range of materials and geometries.
QHT’s ability to describe intricate quantum phenomena such as electron spill-out, quantum
tunneling, and longitudinal bulk plasmons positions it as a cornerstone for the future of quantum-
enabled nanophotonics. By addressing its current limitations and leveraging advancements in
computational techniques, QHT can pave the way for transformative innovations in the study of
light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

The jellium model within time-dependent density-functional theory to address
quantum effects in nanoplasmonics
JAVIER AIZPURUA
, ANTTON BABAZE
& ANDREI G. BORISOV
Current status
The collective response of a free-electron gas confined by a metal surface or by the boundaries
of a nanoparticle has been one of the main exponents of light control and manipulation at the
nanoscale during the last decades. The capacity of a finite structure to sustain localized surface
plasmons provides one of the most effective mechanisms to localize light below the diffraction
limit in extremely small effective mode volumes, associated with a very large electromagnetic near
field. Classical approaches to calculate the interaction of plasmonic nanoparticles with external
electromagnetic field are typically based on solving Maxwell’s equations within the linear-response
theory, where materials are described by local frequency-dependent dielectric functions. These
approaches have been very successful to address optical properties in field-enhanced spectroscopy
and microscopy. However, nowadays the building blocks in nanoplasmonics reach the realm of
the atomic scale, such as in ultranarrow plasmonic gaps, in metallic clusters, in emitters closely
attached to metallic surfaces, or in picocavity configurations. Strong quantum effects thus emerge,
derived from the inhomogeneous electron density distribution at the boundaries as well as from
nonlocal dynamical screening [59,254,255].
A powerful method to account for quantum effects in the optical response of metal surfaces
or metal nano-objects relies on the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) [256].
Different flavors of TDDFT have been developed in condensed-matter physics and in quantum
chemistry, depending on the properties to be addressed. The most widely used approach is
based on the Kohn–Sham (KS) scheme. The electron density 𝑛(𝒓, 𝑡) is represented using
effective single-particle orbitals Ψ(𝒓, 𝑡), which evolve in time under the action of the KS potential
𝑣KS(𝑛; 𝒓, 𝑡). This potential comprises the Hartree, exchange–correlation, and external potential,
as well as (pseudo) potentials representing the interaction of electrons with nuclei.
43


===== PAGE 44 =====
The solution of the KS equations within TDDFT in space and time allows for obtaining key
quantities that characterize the linear and nonlinear optical response of a nanosystem, and is a
state-of-the-art full ab initio approach at the forefront of modern theoretical capabilities to address
such response. This approach fully accounts for quantum effects such as i) nonlocal dynamical
screening, ii) finite-size effects and electron spill-out, and iii) charge transfer in close-contact
nanoparticle surfaces [59,254,255]. In a metal–dielectric or metal–insulator–metal configuration,
the TDDFT properly describes multiphoton and optical-field induced photoemission, as well
as optically assisted electron tunneling from one metal to another. This allows for addressing
challenging goals in nanoscale transport related to the engineering of petahertz (PHz) electronic
devices [257].
Challenges and opportunities
Successful applications of TDDFT within a full atomistic description of nanoparticles have
paved the way towards understanding the ultimate limits of field localization in nanoplasmonics,
as well as describing the nonlocal and band structure effects related to the size dependence of
plasmon resonances in (noble) metal clusters [258,259]. However, the high computational cost
of the method prevents studies on large-scale plasmonic systems with a wide parameter variation,
often necessary to gain physical intuition and "nail down" the main nonlocal plasmonic effects.
This challenge is met with the free-electron (jellium) model of TDDFT (JM-TDDFT). In this
method, the ionic cores of the metal are not treated explicitly, but represented by a uniform
charge density, 𝑛+ = (3/4𝜋)𝑟−3
𝑠, where 𝑟𝑠is the Wigner–Seitz radius. Despite its simplicity,
JM-TDDFT has proven to be a reliable and adequate many-body description of the dynamics
of the conduction band electrons in a metal under optical excitation. Results of this approach
have been pivotal for the prediction of quantum phenomena in plasmonics, such as the effect of
electron tunneling across a plasmonic gap and electronic coupling between a quantum emitter
and a plasmonic nanoantenna. Moreover, the nonlocal optical response of metallic nanoparticles
and nanogaps obtained within the JM-TDDFT has been a key reference for benchmarking other
theories [59,254,255,257].
The results of the properties of plasmon modes of metal nanoantennas within the JM-TDDFT,
as well as those regarding the Green’s function of a point-like dipolar emitter in proximity to a
plasmonic dimer highlight the good performance of the dispersive surface-response formalism
which incorporates nonlocality also in the direction parallel to the metal–vacuum interface [255].
This formalism is based on the implementation of Feibelman parameters [194] (see also Secs. 12
and 13 of this Roadmap), 𝑑⊥(𝜔, 𝒌∥) and 𝑑∥(𝜔, 𝒌∥), into modified boundary conditions of
Maxwell’s equations [60,260] to capture extreme nonlocality at interfaces. The real part of the
Feibelman parameter 𝑑⊥(𝜔, 𝒌∥) accounts for the position of the centroid of the induced charge
at a given frequency 𝜔and at a given parallel momentum transfer 𝒌∥, and the imaginary part
determines the probability of creating electron–hole pairs in the surface region. Crucially, it
has been demonstrated that using Feibelman parameters that explicitly depend on 𝜔and 𝒌∥is
significantly more accurate than using Feibelman parameters obtained within the long-wavelength
approximation [255]. These Feibelman parameters 𝑑⊥(𝜔, 𝒌∥) can be obtained using JM-TDDFT
for a flat metal surface [Fig. 12(a)].
One of the main challenges of the surface-response formalism based on Feibelman parameters is
the limited availability of quantum-informed parameters for the different pairs of metal–dielectric
interfaces commonly used in experimental realizations of plasmonics. So far, the jellium model
of metals has been implemented to generate quantum-informed Feibelman parameters, which
allows for addressing nonlocality of free-electron plasmonic nanoparticles [aluminum (Al) and
alkali metals such as sodium (Na)] in vacuum. Such a description is not adequate for silver (Ag)
and gold (Au), routinely used in spectroscopy and microscopy experiments. In these metals,
the localized d-band electrons strongly impact the optical response. Furthermore, the dielectric
44


===== PAGE 45 =====
environment also affects the Feibelman parameters by changing the spill-out of the electron
density and the dynamical screening. To address these effects, a full-atomistic ab initio TDDFT
approach beyond JM-TDDFT needs to be applied (see also Sec. 10 of this Roadmap), which
makes the calculations extremely challenging numerically.
On the other hand, the lighter and more versatile JM-TDDFT opens the door to tackle other
nonlocal and, more generally, quantum effects of light–matter interaction in nanoplasmonics,
where the underlying physics is determined by the conduction electrons. Thus, the intrinsic
nonlinear electromagnetic response of conduction electrons leading to frequency conversion in
nanoplasmonic configurations can be directly obtained within the jellium scheme [Fig. 12(b)],
enabling the identification of different sources of nonlinearity at the microscopic level. Fur-
thermore, JM-TDDFT allows one to describe the field-induced electron emission from metallic
surfaces and tips triggered by single-cycle optical pulses. In particular, when a metallic surface
is facing another one in close proximity [Fig. 12(c)], the bursts of photoemitted electrons exhibit
an intriguing and complex femtosecond dynamics that depends on the waveform of the incident
transient pulse [257]. This opens up perspectives for designing nanoscale PHz optoelectronic
devices.
 
 
Fig. 12. Areas of development of nonlocal nanoplasmonics within the JM-TDDFT
approach. (a) The calculation of Feibelman parameters requires the description of the
metal to be extended to include the effect of localized electron bands and atomistic

performing first-principles calculations of its intrinsic nonlinear optical response
together with the effect of the nanoantenna geometrical boundaries, as in symmetry-
induced nanoplasmonic response to structured light. (c) Ultrafast single cycle optical
pulses induce photocurrents in nanogaps, determined by the dynamics of sub-fs electron
bursts, as described by jellium-based electron models.
Future developments to address challenges
Both short- and long-term developments will be required in the implementation of many-body
calculations of light–matter interaction in the context of nanoplasmonics. The calculation of
Feibelman parameters for interfaces of non-free-electron materials will require the development
of atomistic ab initio calculations of dispersive Feibelman parameters. This will enable the direct
45

implementation of nonlocality in a set of materials such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu),
platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), etc., interfacing dielectrics, of high interest in field-enhanced
catalysis and chemical reactivity. The role of the crystallographic facets and of surface-localized
electronic states could thus be addressed in this way.
In nonlinear nano-optics, specific combinations of the intrinsic nonlinear response of the
electron gas with specific geometrical symmetries shown by certain nanoantennas configurations
could be exploited in nonlinear chiral nanoplasmonics, with the full nonlocal and nonlinear
response directly accounted for by the jellium description of the electron gas. Finally, the fs
photocurrents produced by intense single-cycle optical pulses can be studied in the context of
electron transport in STM junctions, with the ultimate goal of providing theoretical support to
understand and design devices that combine atomic-scale spatial and sub-fs temporal resolution.
Concluding remarks
The jellium model (JM-TDDFT) has been a powerful tool for addressing conduction electron
dynamics and nonlocal effects in metallic nanoparticles during the last years, offering a
computationally efficient yet accurate framework for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena
in nanoplasmonics. Moreover, it is evident that this methodology holds significant potential for
future advancements, particularly in deepening our understanding of nonlinear nano-optics and
ultrafast optoelectronics. At the same time, the development of more sophisticated atomistic
descriptions beyond the jellium model will be crucial for advancing in the development of quantum-
informed nonlocality. Together, these developments will not only expand our fundamental
knowledge of light-matter interaction but also contribute to the design of applications in quantum
technologies and ultrafast photonics.

Atomic scale nonlocal plasmonics
PU ZHANG
& XUE-WEN CHEN
Overview
Nanoplasmonics is continuously pursuing ever tighter light confinement. With the conceptual
innovations and advances in nanofabrication, the compressed plasmonic field inevitably encounters
the eventual graininess of material, or reaches the atomic scale. Studying the impact of the
atomic scale structure on the plasmonic response and related applications constitutes atomic
scale plasmonics. Holding the promise of achieving the ultimate light confinement and enormous
enhancement of light-matter interaction, this research direction opens up an avenue for the
plasmonics realm. In this contribution we start with a brief account of atomic scale plasmonics
from its commencement to the current status, necessarily reflecting the personal view of the
authors. Then we identify some opportunities and challenges faced by this flourishing field.
Emphasis is placed on the nonlocal effects and theoretical analysis of the extremely localized
field.
Current status
Spatial confinement of light is one of the most important strategies to boost light-matter interaction,
which lies at the core of the majority, if not all, of light technologies. Conducting material-
based nanostructures with abundant and freely moving electrons serve as the driving force for
light confinement, as they are able to leverage both the non-resonant lightning rod effect from
morphology induced electron accumulation and the resonant augment from the localized surface
plasmon resonance. With the typical nanoplasmonic constructs such as sharp tips, nanogap
structures and cascaded assemblies, the localized optical field reaches the nanoscale and even
smaller. Going a step forward nanoplasmonics encounters the graininess of material. Atomic scale

plasmonics was initiated with theoretical exploration. From the theoretical perspective, classical
electromagnetic theory with the local response approximation, or the description of material
by the permittivity 𝜀(𝜔), is normally applied in plasmonics, but starts to fail for plasmonic
field squeezed into nanoscale spaces because of the emerging nonlocal effects. The alternatives
include continuum nonlocal theories (see Sec. 3 of this Roadmap), which effectively provide a
description based on a spatially dispersive permittivity 𝜀(𝜔, 𝒌), and ab initio approaches. Being
a representative of the latter, time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) encompasses
all the non-classical effects of electrons, and is originally developed to treat atomic structures.
Using TD-DFT beyond the jellium approximation (see Sec. 9 of this Roadmap), the impact of
the atomic structure on the plasmonic near field was first investigated and highlighted in a study
on the sodium (Na) cluster dimers consisting of over 600 atoms in total [261]. As shown in
Fig. 13(a), the near-field pattern clearly has the imprint of the detailed atomic structure. The
atoms at the cluster surface shape the localized field into irregular distributions. Intense field
even appears in the atomic voids and crevices. The hot spot in the plasmonic near field is of
particular importance. Much attention was focused on the formation of hot spots in similar
atomic cluster dimers. In particular, an asymmetric dimer in the tip-to-facet configuration
illustrated in Fig. 13(b) was successfully predicted with TD-DFT to generate hot spots of down
to 0.4 nm2 lateral area [258]. The underlying mechanism is recognized as the non-resonant
lightning rod effect. The first experimental observation relevant to atomic scale plasmonics was

reported in low-temperature time-series surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [262].
Fluctuational bright flashes were spotted in the real-time spectra besides persistent signals. The
experiment was interpreted with the introduction of the "picocavity" in Fig. 13(c), where the
plasmonic hot spot at a gold (Au) adatom activated by laser irradiation couples with an individual
molecular bond. The interpretation was supported by the experimental observations including
the extreme enhancement of the optomechanical coupling and alteration of SERS selection
rules by strong optical field gradient. The picocavity has a Raman localization volume below
1 nm3. Apart from the enormously enhanced Raman scattering, this highly localized hot spot
boasts great potentiality in various types of ultrasensitive detection and sensing. For instance,
a silver (Ag) tip decorated with an Ag cluster has been shown able to realize sub-nanometer
resolution single-molecule photoluminescence imaging [263]. In this case the atomic structure,
or the Ag cluster, is transferred to the tip apex during tip indentations, instead of activated by
laser stimulation. Nevertheless, neither methods can deterministically produce stable atomic
protrusions. The beyond-single-adatom stable atomic protrusion sketched in Fig. 13(d) is being
actively sought for [264,265].

resonant and (c) resonant frequencies calculated with quantum hydrodynamic theory

Challenges and opportunities
The vibrantly progressing research area of atomic scale plasmonics certainly faces prominent
challenges, which in the meanwhile signify great opportunities. In this section we name a few
outstanding ones in hope that they could inspire more research interest in the area. The most
fundamental question would be "What is the ultimate limit of light confinement?". Before
any meaningful discussion on the topic, what needs to be resolved in the first place is how to
characterize quantitatively the degree of light confinement with a consistent standard. While
mode volume is routinely used for the purpose, the way it is evaluated varies a lot from case
to case. For instance, Ref. [262] obtained the 1 nm3 Raman localization volume referring to
the Raman scattering enhancement by the picocavity. A more widely accepted approach is
the mode volume according to the mode theory of optical microcavity. However, the nonlocal
effects including electron nonlocality, electron spill out and nonlocal damping, manifested in
atomic scale plasmonics, call for a non-classical theory. Quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT)
elaborated on in Sec. 8 is a viable option. The quasinormal mode theory (QNM) has recently
been generalized to QHT, so that a mode theory-based mode volume can be defined in atomic
scale plasmonics [241,266]. Therein the nonlocal effects are encapsulated into the restoring

(52)
which constitutes a general theoretical framework for any continuum linear response theory and
facilitates the establishment of the corresponding QNM theory. According to the QHT-QNM
theory, picocavity working under the non-resonant lightning rod mechanism has a several tens
of nm3 mode volume. Plotted in logarithmic scale the local field still spreads across the whole
nanogap as illustrated in Fig. 14(b). In contrast, the QHT-QNM theory helps discover an
extremely localized mode (ELM) supported by the atomic protrusion [266]. At the resonant
frequency its mode volume turns out about 1 nm3, with the modal field in Fig. 14(c) extremely
localized at the protrusion. Moreover, the ELM can be made very radiative with a 30% efficiency
when coupled with a host antenna. The resonance of the protrusion was also pointed out through
the local response calculations [267,268]. Nevertheless, whether 1 nm3 mode volume represents
the ultimate light confinement is still an open question. When an optical field is localized on
the atomic scale, or commensurate with the extent of the electron wave function, it is naturally
expected susceptible to the ambient conditions. Apart from serving for ultrasensitive detection,
tuning the optical response with another physical factor in a controlled manner is a promising
avenue. At an atomic scale protrusion, the minute number of electrons responsible for the optical
response implies that the tuning could be ultrafast and energy efficient. In fact, by using a QHT
tamed for noble metals and the corresponding QNM theory, electro-optic modulation of the
ELM has been proposed [221, 269]. A 20 fs response time and below 100 aJ per-bit energy
consumption were predicted. We note electrical control is far from the only way to modulate
the atomic scale plasmon. It is tempting to explore, both theoretically and experimentally, such
modulation via e.g. thermal and mechanical stimuli in multi-physics systems. Since the debut of
atomic scale plasmonics, the interactions with quantum processes like molecular vibration [262],
photoluminescence [270] and exciton [269] are of particular importance for fundamental interest
and potential applications. The tightly confined optical field is able to remarkably expedite the
processes and as well to unlock originally forbidden ones by breaking the selection rules with the
strong field gradient [262]. There’s still much room left to tap the ELM for boosting light-matter
interaction, but it is accompanied with intricate issues. Currently the typical atomic scale
protrusions are generated dynamically through laser activation, and become destroyed equally
fast at room temperature. The probabilistic nature severely limits the practical application of
picocavity enhanced processes. In addition, the lack of controllable realization of an atomic scale
protrusion prevents matching the protrusion’s resonant frequency with the intrinsic frequencies of
the quantum processes. Almost all the existing studies only leverage the non-resonant lightning
rod effect of the protrusion.
Future developments to address challenges
Facing the challenges we then discuss future developments hopeful for answering the questions.
Light confinement needs to be characterized with the consideration of the working wavelength.
In the visible and near infrared range, light confinement has been reported theoretically to reach
1 nm3, but the limit was not addressed. Since the electron response to optical excitation is at the
bottom of the mechanisms of light confinement, the length scale of the ultimate confinement, if
it exists, should be related to that of the electrons in the material, or the extent of the electron
wave function. What role the latter plays in determining the confinement is to be explored. Full
quantum or some sophisticated approximate atomistic approaches would be required for the task.
On the other hand, there are other known strategies for light localization than those leading to the
ELM. Especially applying them to the judicious design of the host of the atomic scale structure is
expected to further compress the field. To exploit the potential of using atomic scale plasmon for
modulation, multi-physics scenarios become highly relevant. The existing theories and numerical
49


===== PAGE 50 =====
models for plasmonic response must coherently incorporate the controlling physical factor of
interest to characterize its nonlinear coupling with the plasmonic field. In this regard, the QHT is
a convenient theoretical platform, as it directly deals with the foundational quantities of electron
and current densities. The influences of the controlling factors on the densities are usually easy
to introduce in a first-principles fashion as in electro-optic modulation [237]. A comprehensive
modulation study necessarily involves inspecting the dynamic tuning process, and thus a time-
domain theory is indispensable. At least for QHT, however, the time-domain implementation is
challenging (see Sec. 8 of this Roadmap), let alone one generalized to multi-physical systems.
Aside from used for information processing, modulating the atomic scale plasmon enables
tuning its resonance to match with quantum processes, so that the enhancement is maximized.
Deterministic preparation of a stable atomic scale structure poses an obstacle to the practical
application. While beyond-single-adatom stable atomic scale structures are alternatives and have
been attempted experimentally in literature, they are still too tiny to be mass fabricated. An
effective approach to circumvent the difficulty is to work with highly doped semiconductors
instead of metals. Except the working frequency is shifted to the infrared range, almost all
the intriguing features are realizable with structures correspondingly scaled to decananometers,
which are readily feasible with the current nanofabrication techniques. The extremely localized
field is retained considering the mode volume normalized with respect to the wavelength cubed.
Dramatic plasmon modulation is also within reach owing to the relatively large screening length
in semiconductors. Adapting the non-classical theories to semiconductors is however in need for
the new expedition.
Concluding remarks
Atomic scale plasmonics is a natural development of nanoplasmonics. In this contribution
we briefly discussed the current status of this frontier, the challenges and opportunities, and
envisioned the future development. Although the picocavity and extremely localized mode
represent actively studied topics of atomic scale plasmonics, more diverse plasmonic field
localized in atomic scale structures are worthwhile to look into. Plasmonic field squeezed into
atomic scale slots was introduced to explain transient "flare" emission observed in plasmonic
cavities [271]. "picophotonics" was also coined for the study on the microscopic optical waves in
the atomic lattice [272].

Nonlocal limitations to light–matter interactions
CHRISTOS TSERKEZIS
Current status
Probably the biggest appeal of plasmonic nanostructures is related to the impact they can have
on enhancing light–matter interactions. Individual plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs), and even
more so plasmonic cavities, provide a dramatic increase in the local density of optical states
(LDOS), allowing to control the properties of quantum emitters (QEs) placed near them. This
potential manifests in both the so-called weak- and strong-coupling regimes. Under weak coupling
conditions, the plasmonic nanostructure is treated as a dielectric environment that alters both the
excitation and the emission rate of QEs via the Purcell effect, allowing e.g. to control molecular
fluorescence, at the single-molecule level [273–275]. In the strong-coupling regime, the QE
hybridizes with the optical modes of the cavity, and the two components enter a coherent and
reversible exchange of energy, that results in the formation of half-light–half-matter entities,
called polaritons [182,276,277]. In the case of cavities, the local response approximation (LRA)
predicts a diverging field enhancement as the gap between individual components shrinks [278].
This unphysical situation reflects the structural weaknesses of LRA. Nonlocality imposes more
50


===== PAGE 51 =====
realistic limits to the performance of nanostructures, especially plasmonic ones; the spatial extent
of induced charges, together with the increased Landau damping as a result of collisions with
the nanostructure boundaries, regularize the plasmonic near-field enhancement, as discussed
already in Ref. [84]. Such limitations have been verified ever since for individual NPs [77] and
coupled structures [279], probed with a variety of sources including swift electrons and point
dipoles [83,195,280].
Weak coupling. The hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM) was employed already in the
1980s to study the emission of a point dipole near a flat metallic surface [281], while NPs were
more actively considered in the late 2000s [282]. Detailed studies of fluorescence enhancement
followed a few years later [126,283–287], and Purcell factors have been calculated for NPs of
various shapes [288, 289], or for stratified media [290], employing both HDM and the more
recent generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory [65]. These studies highlighted
that fluorescence can be affected in two additive ways by nonlocality. At first, as sketched in
Fig. 15(a), the QE has to make the transition from the ground, 𝑆0, to the excited, 𝑆2 state, a
process that is governed by the 𝒑d · 𝑬interaction, where 𝒑d is the dipole moment of the QE, while
𝑬is the total field experienced by it, maximized at plasmonic resonances. The frequency shifts
predicted by HDM become thus important for the efficient excitation of the QE, as they detune
plasmonic resonances from the transition energy. In the second process, after being excited to
𝑆2, the QE quickly relaxes to a metastable state 𝑆1 at a close energy, from which it then decays
spontaneously to the ground state after a characteristic time 𝜏. When placed near plasmonic
NPs, the QE can couple to the radiative dipolar mode, but also to higher-order multipoles, which
are non-radiative. Depending on the QE–NP separation, one of the two couplings prevails,
as quantified by the ratio of radiative over total decay rates. An optimum QE–NP separation
can thus be identified, and it is strongly modified once nonlocal damping is taken into account
[see e.g. Fig. 15(b) for GNOR calculations; Landau damping dominates the process, much of
the energy is absorbed by the NP, and the QE needs to be placed farther away from the NP
surface for an efficient radiative coupling [284]]. This situation is slightly different when the
QE is placed within a plasmonic cavity, because the hybrid plasmon modes they sustain are
more radiative. Different types of plasmonic cavities have been considered within the context
of HDM and GNOR [126], with the main conclusion being that nonlocality tends to regularize
the maximum enhancement that is possible for decreasing gaps, bringing theoretical predictions
closer to experimental measurements [275].
Strong coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, single QEs, or QE collections supporting
collective excitonic modes, interact with a cavity mode, leading to the formation of hybrid
polaritonic states [291–293]; the energy difference between the hybrid modes is known as the
Rabi splitting. The main question regarding nonlocality is: can it affect the coupling strength, e.g.
by weakening the interacting EM fields, or by detuning the plasmonic mode? In a first attempt to
answer these questions, Ref. [294] considered plasmon–exciton coupled systems in a spherical
core–shell geometry. Taking into account that in any experiment the plasmonic resonances will be
characterized by the measured frequencies and linewidths, with any nonlocal effects intrinsically
included, anticrossing spectra were plotted renormalized to the plasmonic resonances predicted
within each model, for different nonlocal models, showing an almost perfect superposition of
anticrossings; both hybrid modes shift, as a result of nonlocality, by the same amount, leading
to negligible differences in the width of the Rabi splitting. The damping introduced by the
nonlocal models is small enough to ensure that no significant broadening occurs, and the main
strong-coupling criterion of the Rabi splitting being larger than the average damping rate of the
uncoupled modes [276] still holds. A similar response has been observed with electron-beam
excitation as well [295]. With a different starting point, Ref. [285] placed QEs with adjustable
oscillator strength inside different plasmonic cavities, and observed that the threshold for entering
the strong-coupling regime would shift depending on the applied model (see Fig. 15(c), for three

different cavities, within LRA, HDM, and GNOR). The main difference between Refs. [294]
and [285] is exactly in the oscillator strength of the excitonic material; while the former assumed
a collective emitter layer that would always have a large enough dipole moment to enter the
strong-coupling regime, the latter explored the conditions for a single QE to achieve this.
Challenges and opportunities
The above discussion is more relevant in noble-metal NPs and cavities, with high work functions
and negligible electron spill-out. The picture is expected to change if spill-out dominates, as
in alkali metals. This has only recently started being considered; for instance, in Ref. [296]
the self-interaction Green’s function was calculated for sodium nanospheres and nanosphere
dimers, both within the surface-response formalism (SRF) based on Feibelman parameters, and
within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), showing that the results deviate
considerably from the predictions of LRA, already for QE–NP distances or interparticle gaps as
large as 2.5 nm. Interestingly, the semiclassical SRF treatment was in excellent agreement with
TDFFT down to ∼0.7 nm. Nevertheless, deviations were observed for even smaller distances;
these were attributed to the fact that the standard SRF is based on local Feibelman parameters,
usually obtained for flat metal–dielectric interfaces. Eventually the curvature of the structure
needs to be included [232, 297]; this was done by the introduction of nonlocal Feibelman
parameters [255], which is, however, still a rather challenging task, both in terms of obtaining
those parameters, and implementing them in computational electrodynamics. NP dimers were
studied in Ref. [298], focusing on the role of the electron tunneling that comes as a result of
spill-out in two sodium nanospheres separated by sub-nm gaps. This study, performed with
52


===== PAGE 53 =====
the quantum hydrodynamic (QHT) model [62], also known as self-consistent hydrodynamic
Drude model (SC-HDM) [61]—a generalization of HDM that relaxes the hard-wall boundary
condition—predicted considerable fluorescence quenching inside the cavity, with results that
are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of LRA and HDM; similarly to the case
of noble-metal NPs, nonlocality seems to provide the upper limits to the system’s performance.
In the strong-coupling regime, Ref. [299] found that spill-out, and the plasmonic redshifts that
accompany it, do not drastically change Rabi splittings. In a similar study for flat sodium–air
interfaces, strong coupling was indeed retained, also accompanied by a drastic effect on the QE
dynamics, which acquires a strong non-Markovian character [300]. On the other hand, Ref. [301]
observed that the oscillator-strength threshold for achieving strong coupling changes within
each model. In particular, using QHT to account for electron spill-out, a considerable increase
in the oscillator threshold was predicted, also related to the fact that coupling to higher-order
multipoles occurs already for larger QE–NP distances due to the larger effective NP size. Finally,
it is worth mentioning a similar investigation related to the Mollow triplets in QE–NL coupled
systems [302]; using GNOR as the nonlocal model, Ref. [303] observed that the side bands
become stronger and with narrower linewidths, compared to the predictions of LRA.
Historically, nonlocality in plasmonics has been associated with "bad news", i.e. limitations to
the performance of an architecture or a device. While such studies are tremendously important
from a fundamental point of view, to establish the physical mechanisms involved, they also tend
to become slightly unattractive, by predicting less impressive results than those of LRA. There
have only been few situations where nonlocality promised to improve a performance, as e.g.
when it was shown to smooth the surface roughness of a metallic tip [72]. In the context of
light–mater interactions, a recent study [60] showed that nonlocality and electron spill-out have
the potential to enhance dipole-forbidden transitions [304] or plasmon-mediated energy transfer,
eventually showing that nonlocality is not always a limiting factor, but a possibility of harnessing
it for practical applications does exist.
Future developments to address challenges
From the above discussion, it becomes clear that nonlocality can have a strong, and sometimes
unpredictable impact on light–matter interactions. Nevertheless, current literature is large;
restricted to plasmonics, and almost exclusively on a theoretical level. Furthermore, most
studies have only focused on exploring the role of corrections in the response of the plasmonic
component, while the QEs themselves are not considered. There is therefore still plenty of
room for future explorations. First of all, it will be important to consider, both in theory and in
experiment, the impact of nonlocality on other types of light–matter interacting architectures. For
instance, Ref. [305] has made a first effort to address semiconductors, focusing on the radiative
and nonradiative decay rates of multi-subband plasmons in quantum wells. Magnetoplasmonic
systems and Landau polaritons were studied in Ref. [95], which managed to set quantitative
limits to the miniaturization of polaritonic devices and to the enhancement of polariton gaps.
Nonlocality in phonon-polariton resonators was studied in Ref. [306], albeit only on the level of
far-field extinction and reflection properties.
At the same time, one is justified to ask, to what extent it is appropriate to continue refining the
description of photonic nanostructures, while retaining the simple point-dipole approximation for
the QE. It is almost inevitable that the next generation of nonlocal studies will have to introduce
both a quantum-electrodynamic treatment of the problem [38, 307], and also more elaborate
models for the QEs, either entering the domain of computational quantum chemistry [308], or
with semiclassical models as suggested e.g. in Ref. [301]. Strong coupling of a QE with a film
described by a hydrodynamic or a Lindhard permittivity has been explored in Ref. [309], but
retaining again some level of approximation. And this only makes sense, as quantization of the
"cavity modes" for open, dispersive and lossy cavities, can be tricky [277]. Macroscopic cavity

quantum electrodynamics (QED) appears to be the most promising route right now, but obviously
no treatment can be seen as the unique, conclusive answer yet. This will require a combination of
further theoretical work, possibly with the introduction of new numerical methods for mesoscopic
electrodynamics [310,311], but more importantly, realization of fine experiments that can probe
the small modal shifts and damping involved, and unambiguously attribute them to nonlocality.
Concluding Remarks
Nonlocality plays an important role in light–matter interactions, by introducing detuning and
additional damping that can modify the coupling strength between plasmonic environments and
QEs. It is, however, important to broaden the horizon of such studies by also departing from the
point-dipole description of the QE, while more efficient computational methods might still be
needed. On the other hand, nonlocality is much less explored when QE environments other than
plasmonic are concerned, and this promises to be an active direction in the near future.

Quantum surface-response functions for nanoplasmonics: Feibelman pa-
rameters
THOMAS CHRISTENSEN
, WEI YAN
& YI YANG
Current status
The study of quantum-response effects in nanoplasmonics has often centered on the incorporation
of specific physical effects otherwise omitted in the piecewise-constant, local-response outset that
underlies conventional (or "classical") electromagnetic modeling (CEM). Focus has especially
centered on the incorporation of one of the three key omissions in CEM, namely (1) bulk nonlocal
response (i.e., the finite range of the dielectric tensor 𝜺(r, r′) with respect to |r −r′|), (2) the
non-abrupt and smooth variation of the electron density near material surfaces (e.g., Friedel
oscillations and electron spill-out), and (3) absorption processes involving non-negligible change
of quasiparticle momentum (e.g., surface-enabled Landau damping). While such single-effect
explorations have yielded valuable physical and conceptual insights, they are challenged by the
reality that no single beyond-CEM effect strongly dominates the others in general and, moreover,
that they may act in opposition. In extreme cases, including only one effect may decrease
predictive power, as in the case of hydrodynamic accounts of nonlocality for simple metal surface
plasmons. Observations of beyond-CEM deviations should therefore generally be expected as
arising from the interplay of multiple, physically distinct effects.
Feibelman identified this challenge in the early eighties and introduced his eponymous 𝑑⊥and
𝑑∥parameters as a possible remedy [194,312], further developed with subsequent contributions
from Apell, Liebsch, and others [313–315]. In particular, the CEM implies that induced charge
density is accumulated only at interfaces, and consequently amounts to a zeroth-order (monopole)
approximation of a multipole expansion of a continuously varying induced charge density. 𝑑⊥
parameterizes the omitted first-order (dipole) term of this expansion and 𝑑∥parameterizes the
discrepancy between the classical and quantum-mechanical monopole terms (i.e., total charge);
together, they capture the leading-order corrections to CEM [232,297]. Considering a planar
interface (residing at, say, 𝑥= 0), 𝑑⊥and 𝑑∥are the frequency-dependent centroids of the induced
charge density 𝜌(𝑥, 𝜔)𝑒𝑖𝑘𝑦[Fig. 16(a)] and the normal derivative of the tangential current
density 𝐽𝑦(𝑥, 𝜔)𝑒𝑖𝑘𝑦due to an incident plane wave propagating in the 𝑥𝑦-plane at frequency

As centroids of induced quantities, 𝑑⊥and 𝑑∥have units of length with complex amplitudes in
the Ångström-range for typical plasmonic materials. They represent surface-response functions
of the interface (i.e., intrinsic functions of the material composition across the interface) that
describe the tendency of interfaces to polarize, analogously to how the bulk permittivity 𝜀
describes the tendency of a bulk material to polarize. The associated surface polarization is [260]:
𝝅= 𝜀0𝑑⊥⟦𝐸⊥⟧ˆn −𝜀0𝑑∥⟦D∥/𝜀0⟧,
(54)
with ⟦f⟧≡f(r + 0+ ˆn) −f(r + 0−ˆn) denoting the discontinuity of a field f across interface with
normal ˆn and with 𝑓⊥= ˆn · f and f∥= (I −ˆnˆnT)f denoting the field’s normal and tangential
parts. Unlike the bulk polarization, sourced by the E-field amplitude, the surface polarization is
sourced by the interface-discontinuities ⟦𝐸⊥⟧and ⟦D⊥⟧. Compellingly, the corrections to CEM
are thus driven by CEM’s failure to achieve field continuity.
While Feibelman’s original formulation focused only on planar interfaces, the surface po-
larization formulation—and the recognition that any surface-curvature dependence of 𝑑⊥,∥is
negligible for leading-order beyond-CEM considerations [297,314]—generalizes the scope to
arbitrary photonic structures [232,260]. Moreover, as discovered three and a half decades after
the Feibelman parameters’ introduction, the surface polarization can in fact be abstracted away
through a modification of the CEM boundary conditions [260]:
⟦𝐷⊥⟧= 𝑑∥∇∥· ⟦D∥⟧,
⟦𝐵⊥⟧= 0,
(55a)
⟦E∥⟧= −𝑑⊥∇∥⟦𝐸⊥⟧,
⟦H∥⟧= 𝐼𝜔𝑑∥⟦D∥⟧× ˆn.
(55b)
While Eqs. (55) are amenable to direct incorporation in full-wave computational frameworks,
the general smallness of beyond-CEM corrections naturally suggests perturbative approaches.
Such approaches have been pursued in both nonretarded [297] and retarded [260] settings, suitable
for deep-subwavelength resonators and multi-scale structures respectively. In the latter setting, a
quasi-normal mode perturbation theory [317] gives the leading-order shift 𝜔1 of the complex
resonance frequency 𝜔= 𝜔0 + 𝜔1 + . . . from the CEM frequency 𝜔0 [260]:
𝜔1 = 𝜔0(𝜅⊥𝑑⊥+ 𝜅∥𝑑∥),
(56)
with mode-, shape- and scale-dependent perturbation amplitudes 𝜅⊥,∥(inverse length units),
obtainable from CEM quasi-normal modes, and with 𝑑⊥,∥evaluated at 𝜔0. The perturbative
expression cleanly separates the mode-, shape-, and scale-dependence (𝜅⊥,∥) from the material-
dependence (𝑑⊥,∥) of beyond-CEM shifts. In the nonretarded limit and for a pure plasma (plasma
frequency 𝜔𝑝) adjacent to vacuum, analytical expressions can e.g., be obtained for the resonance
frequency 𝜔sp
𝑘of a surface plasmon wave vector 𝑘at a planar interface (𝜅⊥= −𝜅∥= −1

and for the 𝑙th order localized surface plasmon frequency 𝜔lsp

with 𝑑eff = 𝑑⊥−𝑑∥evaluated at 𝜔0. The incorporation of Feibelman parameters lifts the
characteristic scale-invariance of the nonretarded CEM by introducing the length-scale of 𝑑⊥,∥to
compete with the geometric or modal length-scale 𝐿, resulting in corrections of order O(𝑑eff𝐿−1).
These simple examples also reveal the physical interpretations of the complex parts of 𝑑eff:
i) Re 𝑑eff contributes to a shift of the frequency center, ii) the sign of Re 𝑑eff determines the
shift’s direction (blue-shifting for charge "spill-in", Re 𝑑eff < 0, and red-shifting for "spill-out",
Re 𝑑eff > 0), and iii) Im 𝑑eff contributes size- or momentum-dependent broadening.

Challenges and opportunities
While the introduction Feibelman parameters now lies more 4 decades in the past, the frame-
work’s application to modern nanoplasmonic-response questions remains in an early stage and
several open, unsolved challenges remain. Below, we highlight opportunities and challenges in
experimental and theoretical determination of the Feibelman 𝑑-parameters.
Experimental measurement and tabulation. A key strength of the Feibelman parameters
is that they provide a physics-agnostic framework for incorporating beyond-CEM effects. No
specific physical effects are included or excluded: the physics in the underlying microscopic
response quantities 𝜌and J – equivalently, 𝜺(r, r′) – on which 𝑑⊥,∥depends is automatically

incorporated. Specific models of 𝑑⊥,∥can therefore usually encompass (to leading order) existing
"single-effect" approaches, including e.g., hydrodynamic accounts of nonlocality [194]. This
freedom and versatility, however, brings a concomitant challenge: the values and frequency-
dependence of 𝑑⊥,∥(𝜔) are not prescribed by the framework itself. For real materials, they must
be obtained by experimental measurements or other sophisticated theoretical modeling.
An analogous problem arises for the bulk permittivity 𝜀(𝜔), which has been met extensive
experimental tabulation efforts [318].
By comparing observations of large beyond-CEM
deviations in AlO𝑥–Au thin-film-gapped Au-disks [Fig. 16(b,c)], Yang et al. [260] demonstrated
that equivalent efforts are feasible for the Feibelman parameters, by inferring 𝑑⊥of an Au–AlO𝑥
interface by comparison with perturbation theory [Fig. 16(d)]. Near-field measurements of
highly confined thin-film gap surface plasmons at an Au–Al2O3 interface [86] demonstrate the
feasibility more broadly, as do measurements of beyond-CEM deviations in graphene–metal
heterostructures [93,319].
While feasible, these approaches often require multiple parametrically varied geometries and
are intrinsically limited to the frequency range of the resonant plasmonic feature. Measurements
of the Feibelman parameters across broad frequency ranges is significantly more challenging,
especially above the screened plasma frequency, contending with increased smallness of beyond-
CEM shifts away from resonance and worsened signal-to-noise ratios. Recent efforts have made
strides towards broadband characterizations [Fig. 16(e,f)] [316], by incorporating the Feibelman
parameters into ellipsometric analysis via Feibelman-corrected Fresnel reflection coefficients and,
e.g., demonstrating that while Au spills in at typical surface plasmon frequencies (Re 𝑑⊥< 0), it
spills out above the plasma frequency (Re 𝑑⊥< 0).
Theory and first-principles modeling. State-of-the-art computational modeling of the
Feibelman parameters arguably remains closely aligned with techniques first developed and
applied in the 1980s [128,194]. These techniques leverage time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT), accounting for the dynamics of the highest-lying conduction electrons and
treating the remaining electrons through an effective jellium, i.e., uniform potential (see Sec. 9 of
this Roadmap). This captures the essential physics of simple metals well, since they exhibit only
negligible screening from lower-lying electrons, and correctly predicts spill-out (Re 𝑑⊥> 0) and
beyond-CEM red-shifts (𝜔1 < 0), consistently with measurements [320]. Noble metals, however,
are strongly screened by bound electrons, and exhibit beyond-CEM blue-shifting (𝜔1 > 0)
associated with spill-in (Re 𝑑⊥< 0), contrary to jellium predictions. Even semi-classically
screened generalizations [128,297] do not substantially remedy this mismatch. These facts call
for beyond-jellium calculations of the Feibelman parameters, explicitly incorporating both bound
electrons and ionic potentials, e.g., by leveraging modern TD-DFT software.
First steps have been made through the incorporation of non-uniform atomic potentials which
has e.g., shed light on the influence of crystallographic facet terminations [321]. Many important
questions remain unaddressed, however, including:
1. Influence of dielectric screening for metal–dielectric interfaces [322]. From semiclassical
considerations, 𝑑⊥is expected to scale roughly inversely dielectric permittivity for noble-
metal–dielectric heterostructures [260]. No similar expectation approximate rules arise for
simple metals, however, since their free electrons spill into the dielectric cladding, and a
general, predictive, and accurate modeling scheme has not been developed.
2. Impact of residual chemical elements or few-layer intercalates at interfaces, including the
wetting layers that form under ambient conditions. Their potential influence is crucial for
the interpretation and assignment of experimentally obtained Feibelman parameters.
3. While 𝑑∥vanishes in charge-neutral jellium calculations [313] and has been assumed
small in experimental treatments, the presence of bound-electron screening [128], surface
57


===== PAGE 58 =====
roughness [323], and electronic interface states [321,324] can lift this requirement. An
understanding of the relative amplitudes of 𝑑∥and 𝑑⊥in general settings remains absent.
4. Tunability of 𝑑⊥,∥by external means, e.g., applied voltages or strain. Recent experiments by
Zurak et al. [238] used differential scattering response under voltage gating of a plasmonic
nanoresonator [Fig. 16(g)] to estimate the associated tunability of the Feibelman parameters,
finding sensitivities on the order of 10−1 pm/V for 𝑑⊥at Au–air interfaces [Fig. 16(h)].
A full theoretical understanding of these experimental results as well as whether larger
tunability is attainable by other external controls are exciting open questions.
5. Jellium TD-DFT’s failure to model Re 𝑑⊥,∥(frequency shift) also limits its ability to
model Im 𝑑⊥,∥(frequency broadening) due to Kramers–Kronig relations. The impact of
bound-electron screening on beyond-CEM broadening is thus still poorly understood. One
open question is whether some plasmonic materials might be naturally "quantum low-loss"
(i.e., small Im 𝑑⊥,∥) or "quantum high-loss" (i.e., large Im 𝑑⊥,∥), which may constrain
outlooks for low-loss ultra-confined plasmons and hot-electron generation, respectively.
6. The electron–phonon coupling and phonon-assisted transitions play a significant role
in the bulk losses of materials [325]. Surprisingly little, however, is known about the
electron–phonon coupling’s impact on surface damping. E.g., the contribution to Im 𝑑⊥
from phonon-assisted transitions is not currently understood, nor is its relative magnitude
compared to intraband electron–hole pair transitions (surface-enabled Landau damping).
Answering these questions will likely necessitate new computational and algorithmic develop-
ments for TD-DFT approaches of thin-film and interfacial optical response.
In both theoretical and experimental pursuits of the Feibelman parameters’ values, two facts
are helpful to validate obtained results and ensure physical consistency. First, since the Feibelman
parameters are response functions, they are causal and consequently obey Kramers–Kronig
relations, which equips them with several useful sum rules [326]. Second, passivity—i.e.,
that linear passive materials do no net work on the electromagnetic fields—also constrains
the Feibelman parameters, just as it constrains the local permittivity by Im(𝜔𝜀) ≥0. In
particular, passivity requires that Im(𝜔𝑑⊥⟦𝜀−1⟧) ≥0 and Im(𝜔𝑑∥⟦𝜀⟧) ≤0 for all frequencies
(Im 𝜔> 0) [316].
Future developments to address challenges
While the noted opportunities largely fall within Feibelman’s original scope, i.e., anchored in
plasmonics, future developments may well be driven most efficiently by pursuing an expanded
scope and generalizations of the underlying ideas of surface-response functions.
One particularly apt and simple example of such possible generalizations of scope is doped
semiconductors, which are excellent candidates for realizing large beyond-CEM corrections due
to long Fermi wavelengths and pronounced nonlocal response [327]. As are generalizations to
synthetically nonlocal meta-materials. In particular, we anticipate that both phenomenological
and semiclassical modeling of the Feibelman parameters may be sufficient to match experiments,
since these materials afford a clearer separation between the involved beyond-CEM length-scales
than metals. In turn, this may inform and revitalize phenomenological modeling approaches for
Feibelman parameters of metals.
More broadly, several other material and quasiparticle platforms support ultra-confined
optical modes, which may correspondingly host substantial beyond-CEM corrections. Polar
materials such as hexagonal boron nitride, for instance, supports highly-confined surface phonon
polaritons [328]. Even ordinary high-index dielectrics, such as silicon, can support ultra-confined,
nanometer-scale optical modes in the gaps of bowtie nano-antennae [329]. Lacking mobile

charge carriers, the physical mechanisms for beyond-CEM effects must involve phonons in
either material platform, rather than electrons alone: accordingly, the momentum-dependence
of the electron–phonon coupling appears likely to play a key role. Importantly, regardless of
the underlying physical mechanism, the Feibelman-parameter framework will be applicable
due to its physics-agnostic formulation. Recent observations of super-thermal evaporation at
water surfaces [330,331], suggest that even broader material classes may exhibit beyond-CEM
effects associated with nonzero Feibelman parameters, with physical mechanisms that are wholly
unrelated to the Fermi liquid perspective of plasmons. Even the classical effects of surface
roughness can be abstracted into the framework [323], a fact that is important to hold in view for
experimental inference of Feibelman parameters.
The existence of nonlocality, even the mere existence of an interface, is also known to enable
nonlinear effects otherwise forbidden in a local-response bulk. This includes second-harmonic
generation in centrosymmetric materials. Generalizations of Feibelman parameters to the
nonlinear domain, e.g., for capturing hydrodynamic accounts of nonlinearity [332], would
consequently be of substantial interest for describing surface-enabled nonlinear phenomena. The
fact that the second-harmonic nonlinear susceptibility of an interface contains terms proportional
to the interface-discontinuity of the electric field [333] is highly encouraging in this regard.
Taken together, these outlooks suggest the possibility of more far-reaching generalizations to
physical problems beyond electromagnetism. At their core, the Feibelman parameters amount to a
leading-order remedy of the field discontinuity imposed by the simple but unphysical assumptions
of piecewise constant, and local response. Such assumptions are widespread in physics, spanning
e.g., heat transport, acoustics, and semiconductor physics. These facts suggest that many notions
of surface- and interface-response functions might find generalization and unification in the ideas
underlying the Feibelman parameters.
Concluding remarks
The Feibelman parameters provide a natural and elegant framework for incorporating the salient
beyond-classical effects in electromagnetic modeling. While the physics of Feibelman parameters
for jellium plasma have been well-understood for decades, many questions remain open for
the real materials of interest to contemporary polaritonics, e.g., metals, doped semiconductors,
polar materials, and high-index dielectrics. In addition to these questions, there are broad
opportunities for generalizations and extensions of the underlying ideas to physics beyond linear
electromagnetism. We hope this overview provides an interesting and illustrative selection of
such questions and opportunities, and that it may serve to inspire future contributions to the field.

Computational electrodynamics with Feibelman surface-response formalism

Current status
Metallic nanoparticles can focus light down to extreme sub-wavelength volumes through excitation
of surface plasmons, these are coherent surface charge oscillations of electrons at the metal
surface [334]. The question of how to account for quantum surface effects around sharp particle
features, small gap regions, or for incoming fields with high spatial variations such as those
produced by quantum emitters in the vicinity of a particle, has puzzled researchers for several
decades. A particularly appealing solution is due to Feibelman [194] (see also Sec. 12 of this
Roadmap), who devised an approach where all quantum modifications at the boundary are lumped
into two dispersive so-called Feibelman parameters, which provide a measure of the distance
over which the electric fields deviate from those for a sharp interface. Feibelman parameters
were first brought to the field of plasmonics in [59] for the explanation of confinement-induced

plasmon shifts, and further developed to include surface-induced nonlocal effects in the optical
response of arbitrarily-shaped plasmonic nanoparticles [232]. More recently [60,260], it has
been suggested that Feibelman parameters can be directly incorporated into classical Maxwell
solvers by introducing modified "mesoscopic" boundary conditions. By comparing results
from modified Mie theory including Feibelman parameters with those of ab initio simulations
based on time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) [255], it has been shown that for
electromagnetic field variations on the nanometer scale one should rather consider Feibelman
parameters that are nonlocal in the directions tangential to the boundary, in accordance to the
original work of Feibelman who considered for a planar slab geometry a parameter dependence
on the wavevector components parallel to the interface. Despite the strong recent interest in
Feibelman parameters and mesoscopic boundary conditions, there are surprisingly few attempts
to implement them into computational Maxwell solvers. In the seminal paper of [260] the authors
proposed two methods for dealing with such boundary conditions in the COMSOL Multiphysics
software based on the finite-element method (FEM): either by introducing an additional scalar
auxiliary potential together with a surface current, or by computing the quasinormal modes of the
system under study and accounting for the modifications due to the Feibelman parameters in lowest
order of perturbation theory. Both approaches lead to simulations that are slower in comparison
to those using normal boundary conditions. As an alternative approach, in Refs. [310,335] we
have developed the methodology for directly introducing mesoscopic boundary conditions into a
Maxwell solver based on the boundary element method (BEM), using either local or nonlocal
Feibelman parameters, and have implemented them in our software toolbox nanobem [336].
Agreement with analytic results based on a modified Mie theory has been demonstrated for single
and coupled spheres, together with the expected computational convergence when increasing the
number of boundary elements. Further developments are needed to bring our software to a form
that can be used flexibly by other users, and to set up a database for Feibelman parameters for
various material combinations.
Challenges and opportunities
For computational Maxwell solvers incorporating local or nonlocal Feibelman parameters, the
main challenges concern the methodology and the numerical implementation. To understand
the challenges, we have to briefly dwell on some of the technicalities. In BEM, the Calderon
identities, see Eq. (9.55) of Ref. [334], relate the tangential electromagnetic fields at the particle
boundary to the incoming fields, for instance those produced by plane waves or quantum emitters
placed in the vicinity of the particle. Together with the boundary conditions, one can use the
identities to compute the unknown tangential fields and, in turn, the fields everywhere else. When
considering Feibelman parameters, one can start from the same Calderon identities, and only the
field matching at the boundary has to be modified. Here one has to be careful about the tangential
derivative ∇∥(𝑑⊥◦⟦𝐸⊥⟧) in the mesoscopic boundary conditions [260], where the electric field
component normal to the boundary 𝐸⊥additionally has to be related in BEM to the tangential
magnetic field 𝐻∥through Ampère’s law. This leaves us with two tangential derivatives in the
mesoscopic boundary condition. Fortunately, they can be handled in the same manner as the
hypersingular operator in the Galerkin implementation of BEM, see Eq. (11.40) of Ref. [334],
namely by swapping the derivatives through integration by parts to the Raviart–Thomas shape
elements 𝑓𝜈(𝑟∥) that are used for the representation of the tangential electromagnetic fields at the
boundary. Furthermore, the derivative ∇· ˆ𝑛× 𝑓𝜈(𝑟∥) originating from this partial integration,
with ˆ𝑛being the outer surface normal, has to be related to ∇∥· 𝑓𝜈(𝑟∥) using a suitable translation
procedure [310]. The important point for our discussion here is that through this translation
not only neighbor but also distant shape elements become directly coupled when matching
the tangential fields at the boundary, even for local Feibelman parameters, as can be seen in
Fig. 17(b,b*) for the matching matrix before and after translation. Quite generally, dense matrices

by computing local or nonlocal Feibelman parameters within an ab initio approach,
which can be submitted to the mesoscopic boundary conditions and implemented
in a BEM solver. The latter provides us with 𝑇-matrices that could be used for the
simulation of particle clusters or particle arrays. (b,c) The lower panels show the
matrices used in our BEM approach for matching the electromagnetic fields at the
boundary, with a representation of the tangential electromagnetic fields in terms of
Raviart–Thomas shape elements (see inset) as global degrees of freedom (DOF). (b) For
local Feibelman parameters the matrix is spare, however, due to the technical details
described in the text and in Refs. [310,335], the (b*) matrix actually used in the BEM
approach is already relatively dense. (c,c*) For nonlocal Feibelman parameters the
matching matrices are equally dense. As the inversion of the matching matrices is
computationally expensive, the performance of our BEM approach is not too different
for local and nonlocal Feibelman parameters.
play a central role in BEM [334] and the inversion of an additional matrix constitutes no major
bottleneck in the computational approach. The same conclusion holds for nonlocal Feibelman
parameters, where from the outset distant shape elements are coupled, see Fig. 17(c), and the
translation procedure leads to matrices that are equally dense than those for local Feibelman
parameters. With the exception of the filling of these matrices, the consideration of nonlocal
Feibelman parameters thus represents no computational drawback. The implementation of local
and nonlocal Feibelman parameters to solve Maxwell’s equations within the BEM requires the
availability of a reliable set of these parameters associated with the boundaries separating two
different media, which can be obtained from a quantum calculation of the optical response of
a flat interface separating the same pair of media. To that end, when it comes to describe an
interface between a dielectric and a free-electron gas of s-like electrons, such as in sodium (Na)
or aluminum (Al), a TDDFT where the metallic medium is considered to be a jellium turns to be
very adequate to describe the surface response [296]. Interfaces involving noble metals such as
gold (Au) or silver (Ag), with a strong effect of d-like electrons on the optical response require
more sophisticated approaches.

Future developments to address challenges
In the future, the computation of Feibelman parameters and the development of Maxwell solvers
incorporating mesoscopic boundary conditions should go hand in hand. Only in combination
they provide a powerful machinery for considering quantum surface effects in classical Maxwell
solvers, and can serve the community as a flexible simulation toolkit.
The current BEM
implementations of the mesoscopic boundary conditions [310,335] are somewhat experimental,
and are neither optimized for flexibility nor speed. In contrast to state-of-the-art BEM solvers,
such as nanobem [336], the additional computation of the matrices for field matching must
properly account for the novel features of a spatial cutoff for the nonlocal Feibelman parameters
𝑑(𝑟∥) and a sufficiently fine integration grid to resolve the spatial variations of 𝑑(𝑟∥). A first
step in this direction has been undertaken in Ref. [335], where we have suggested a separation
of the Feibelman parameters into a local contribution and a remainder, accounting for the most
salient short- and long-range features. Feibelman parameters are expected to be of importance
for sharp particle features, gap structures, or quantum emitters nearby particles, thus calling for a
boundary discretization that is fine in the vicinity of the critical points and coarser further away.
This requires refined integration routines that can efficiently deal with boundary elements of
unequal size. Since the consideration of the boundary matching matrices is computationally
equally expensive for local and nonlocal Feibelman parameters, one must assure that the filling
of these matrices does not become the slowest part of the BEM simulations. nanobem is a
solver particularly suited for small-scale problems. However, with the recent developments of
the toolbox it is now possible to compute 𝑇-matrices, which can incorporate the Feibelman
parameters, and to directly load them into 𝑇-matrix solvers such as SMUTHI or treams. With this
it is possible to simulate clusters, arrays, or metasurfaces. Mesoscopic boundary conditions can
be also implemented in other Maxwell solvers. The approach developed in Refs. [310,335] can
be probably adapted without too many modifications for finite element method (FEM) solvers
using a Galerkin scheme. As for other solvers, such as those based on the finite-difference time
domain (FDTD) or discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) method, it has to clarified how the
spatial derivatives in the tangential directions can be handled. Regarding the challenges in the
calculation of Feibelman parameters, extensive efforts have been invested in developing jellium
TDDFT simulations to obtain local and nonlocal parameters of interfaces involving a purely free
electron gas, however, the implementation of such a nonlocal scheme of parameters for noble
metal crystallographic interfaces is also a need in nowadays nano-plasmonics. Gold and silver
interfaces, for instance, are commonly used in practical optical spectroscopy implementations,
where strong band-structure effects are in place induced by the d-band of more localized-electrons,
and a strong presence of electronic image states also modifies the spectral dependence of the
parameters at lower energies. All of these effects enforce the implementation of atomistic ab
initio calculations of the surface response in periodic supercells, capable to address these issues.
Concluding remarks
Mesoscopic boundary conditions incorporating Feibelman parameters have been recently intro-
duced as a versatile tool to account for quantum surface effects at metal-dielectric interfaces.
However, computational Maxwell solvers incorporating Feibelman parameters are still scarce.
One exception is the boundary element method approach, for which Feibelman parameters that
are either local or nonlocal in the directions tangential to the interface have been implemented
successfully. In the future, we plan to render our software suitable for an easy-to-use and flexible
open-source simulation toolbox, and to supplement it with Feibelman parameters computed with
state-of-the-art ab initio Schrödinger solvers for various material systems.

Nonlocal response in doped semiconductors
MARTIJN WUBS
Current status
Doped semiconductors are a vast and active research field, see Ref. [337] for a recent review. It
is textbook knowledge that the Drude model [43] can describe free-electron systems, not only
metals but also doped semiconductors. In doped semiconductors the response can be due to
combinations of electrons, and light and heavy holes. Free electrons typically have much smaller
reduced masses than holes, so they dominate the response if present. Electron reduced masses
𝑚∗of small-bandgap semiconductors are smaller than in metals. Free-carrier densities in doped
semiconductors are much smaller than in metals. The net effect is that semiconductor plasma
frequencies 𝜔𝑝=
√︁
𝑛𝑒2/(𝜀0𝑚∗) occur in the infrared to THz regimes, compared to the ultraviolet
frequencies for metals.
For nanostructured metals, it is known that the Drude model ceases being accurate because
of nonlocal response and because of "spill-out" across geometric boundaries [see Sec. 3 of
this Roadmap]. Typical sizes (particle radii, thin-film thicknesses) should be well below ten
nanometers to see nonlocal effects in metals. Signatures of nonlocal response in metallic
nanoparticles are the spectral blueshift as particles get smaller, and longitudinal resonances above
the plasma frequency arising in confined geometries, and hydrodynamic surface nonlinearities.
It is therefore interesting whether similar nonlocal effects occur in semiconductors.
In Ref. [340], few-nm sized doped semiconductor nanocrystals are studied in a range of doping
concentrations, showing features ranging from size-quantization to classical plasmonic behavior.
In Ref. [327] it was argued that the hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM) should apply and nonlocal
behavior should be observable in larger doped semiconductor particles, of tens of nanometers
in size (considerably larger than for metals), described by the longitudinal dielectric function
𝜀(𝜔, 𝑘) = 𝜀∞−𝜔2
𝑝/[𝜔2 + 𝑖𝛾𝜔−𝛽2𝑘2]. The surface plasmon resonance of a nanosphere in air
then has a nonlocal blueshift of Δ𝜔= 𝛽/(
√
2𝑅). In small-bandgap semiconductors [such as
indium antimonide (InSb) with 𝐸𝑔= 0.17 eV] electrons are thermally excited to the conduction
band, and at low temperatures the nonlocal parameter becomes 𝛽= 3𝑘B𝑇/𝑚∗
𝑒[327,338]. For
𝑛-doped semiconductors on the other hand, the 𝛽is given by
√︁
3/5(ℏ/𝑚∗)(3𝜋2𝑛)1/3, where
𝑛is the electron density [327, 338]. Thus the same hydrodynamic Drude response function
can describe microscopically quite different situations. In both cases, exciton effects can be
neglected because of large screening. And in both cases, the relative nonlocal blueshift Δ𝜔/𝜔𝑝
for semiconductors – doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) or thermally excited InSb – is much
larger than for metals [327], e.g., silver (Ag), see Fig. 18(b). For the doped semiconductor,
Δ𝜔/𝜔𝑝∝𝑛−1/6(𝑚∗)−1/2/𝑅, which shows that, interestingly, both the lower carrier densities and
smaller reduced masses in semiconductors contribute to larger relative nonlocal blueshifts.
In linear optics, convincing hydrodynamic nonlocal behavior in semiconductors has been
observed in planar geometries: infrared optical nonlocalities due to conduction electrons have
been observed in indium (In)-doped cadmium oxide (CdO) thin films [216], both a nonlocal
blueshift of the main plasmon resonance and two additional longitudinal resonances at higher
energies, for film thicknesses of 20 nm, see Fig. 18(c). In a recent preprint, heavily n-doped
indium arsenide antimonide (InAsSb) thin films are also reported to exhibit nonlocal resonances,
even for film thicknesses up to 200 nm [341]. Also, compact plasmonic-based THz cavities, with
thermal activation of carriers across the small bandgap of InSb, have been shown to operate until
the emergence of nonlocality and Landau damping [96], see Fig. 18(d).
Besides this progress in nonlocality in linear optics, there are interesting developments in the
63


===== PAGE 64 =====
nonlinear response of doped semiconductors as well. Ref. [339] described both the second- and
the third-harmonic response from an indium tin oxide (ITO) nanolayer, modeled as a combination
of bulk and hydrodynamic nonlinear response, see Fig. 18(e). Ref. [236] proposed to use surface
modulation of the equilibrium charge density of heavily doped semiconductors via an external
static potential 𝑛0, see Fig. 18(f). It combines the insights that the hydrodynamic nonlinear
response is a surface rather than a bulk response, and that the third-order nonlinear polarization
is proportional to 1/𝑛2
0, so that a reduction of 𝑛0 at the surface in response to a static potential
can make the nonlinear response orders of magnitude stronger. A recent preprint [235] attributes
the strong third-harmonic response of n-doped indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) thin layers to
free-electron nonlocal response, with measurements agreeing much better with hydrodynamic
than with local-response theory.
Challenges and opportunities
Quantum-confined versus hydrodynamic nonlocality. While for planar geometries, accurate
agreement of hydrodynamic theory and experiment have been found [216,341], for nanoparticles

and for other geometries their local response has been harder to identify as being hydrodynamic.
There can be challenges to make spherical particles, and a more fundamental challenge is to
distinguish hydrodynamic from size-quantization effects that also produce blueshifts as sizes are
reduced [340]. And thus non-classical phenomena, as observed in Ref. [342] for example, may be
due to either. It is difficult to draw a hard boundary, but generally in larger systems, single-particle
size quantization effects become less likely and before we reach larger sizes where classical
plasmonics applies, the hydrodynamic Drude model is expected to apply. While "spill-out" on
the atomic scale is less important for the larger doped semiconductor structures than for metals
that exhibit nonlocal response, charge depletion and inhomogeneous doping levels are novel
possible features – and opportunities – for the semiconductors.
Embedded eigenstates. Recently, it was argued that taking nonlocal response into account
does not destroy embedded eigenstates [343]. On the contrary, nonlocal nanospheres feature
infinitely many such states, and the nonlocality relaxes the size restrictions of local theories.
These do not couple to light, but could be observed instead with electron beams. As nonlocal
effects show up in larger systems in semiconductors, as discussed above, doped semiconductors
may be the preferred system to observe nonlocal embedded eigenstates, probed by electrons.
Two-fluid hydrodynamic response. The optical response of semiconductors may be produced
by more than one type of charge carrier, for example by both heavy and light holes, each with
their corresponding plasma frequency. In Ref. [344], a hybridization theory for two-component
carrier plasmas was proposed, with an antibonding mode where the two components move
in phase depends sensitively on the doping densities, and the low-energy bonding mode with
opposite charge alignment. The antibonding mode agreed well with experiment. A hydrodynamic
two-fluid theory was also proposed for doped semiconductors [142,345]. Observing the predicted
low-energy hybridized hydrodynamic mode is still an open challenge. More generally, in
semiconductors it can be a challenge that plasmon and phonon resonances have similar energies.
Complex nonlocal parameter. In the standard hydrodynamic Drude model, the 𝛽parameter
is real-valued with 𝛽2 = 3𝑣2
𝐹/5 and describes quantum pressure convection, while in the
GNOR extension it is complex-valued [65], with Im 𝛽interpreted as representing induced
charge diffusion and accounting for size-dependent broadening of arbitrary plasmonic structures,
including semiconductors. In the theory for semiconductors of Ref. [216], an imaginary part of 𝛽
is due to the viscosity of the electron gas. Likewise in the theory for semiconductors in Ref. [341],
a second viscosity term appears exactly as the imaginary part of 𝛽2 in the standard hydrodynamic
model. A complex 𝛽is also obtained in Halevi’s formula 𝛽2(𝜔) = (3𝜔/5+𝑖𝛾/3)𝑣2
𝐹/(𝜔+𝑖𝛾) [45],
where 𝛽becomes a running coupling constant interpolating between the 𝜔≪𝛾and 𝜔≫𝛾limits,
see Refs. [45,46,338]. Each of these microscopic mechanisms can be the cause of size-dependent
damping, i.e. the commonly observed broadening of spectra for smaller plasmonic structures.
Yet size-dependent damping could also be caused by surface roughness, or by a combination
of these causes. This makes identifying the actual causes of damping in a given experiment
challenging. For example, in the intriguing quest for signatures of viscous electron plasmas, as
reviewed in Ref. [346], many causes will need to be suppressed or ruled out before size-dependent
plasmonic damping can be uniquely attributed to viscosity of the electron gas, in semiconductor
plasmonics and elsewhere.
Beyond hydrodynamic theory. The hydrodynamic Drude model, or the simple extension
provided by the GNOR model [65], are robust in the sense that their nonlocal dielectric function
accurately describes many optical experiments where nonlocality shows up [236,341]. A more
general dispersion relation for plasmons would be

𝑎2𝑛and 𝑏2𝑛. This general form reduces to 𝜔2 = 𝜔2
𝑝/𝜀∞for the local Drude model and to
𝜔2 + 𝑖𝛾𝜔= 𝜔2
𝑝/𝜀∞+ 𝛽2𝑘2 for the HDM and GNOR models, in each case found by putting
the corresponding epsilon to zero. So in the hydrodynamic theory, both series in powers of 𝑘2
truncate beyond 𝑘2. One reason why higher-order terms would be masked in experiments is
the damping, where the Drude damping plus quadratic damping ∝𝑘2 may be strong enough to
broaden and flatten plasmonic spectra before higher-order dispersion comes in sight for larger
𝑘. By contrast, in an electron energy loss spectroscopy experiment on InSb [338], i.e. with
electrons rather than light, the measurements did not agree well with the hydrodynamic Drude
model, but remarkably well with a Boltzmann–Mermin model. So challenges are to explore this
boundary between theories, to find out whether other electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
experiments can be found where the HDM is accurate, and vice versa to find examples in linear
and nonlinear optics where the HDM ceases to be accurate.
Applications. It has been shown that plasmonic cavities of a few microns in size of low-
carrier density InSb can operate in the nonlocal regime of THz plasmonics [96].
These
tunable cavities may become preferable to metallic ones, with useful modes of operation even
in the nonlocal regime. The recent progress in nonlinear free-electron response of doped
semiconductors [235,236,339], especially their tunable and efficient operation at low carrier
densities, has put nonlocal hydrodynamic theory in the spotlight and may lead to novel schemes
and compact semiconductor devices for second- and third-harmonic generation. Here further
progress depends on material science and design based on demanding simulations of systems
that combine both nonlocal and nonlinear response.
Future developments to address challenges
Combine linear and nonlinear optics. Evidence is mounting that the nonlinear second-
and third-harmonic response of doped semiconductors can largely be attributed to free-carrier
hydrodynamic response. This makes doped semiconductors interesting materials for tunable
on-chip nonlinear devices that may lead to novel applications. On the fundamental side, as
discussed above, the size-dependent linear optics effects of doped semiconductor nanoparticles
have been explained either as due to quantum confinement or as hydrodynamic. In the future,
combining nonlinear with linear measurements may help to identify the hydrodynamic nature (or
not) of the linear response, by studying whether the nonlinear response shows a hydrodynamic
nature.
Comparing optical with conductivity measurements. The relation between Drude con-
ductivity and corresponding dielectric function is well known, and that dielectric functions can
be studied both by optical and electron transport experiments. Some researchers in optics have
attributed the imaginary part of the nonlocal parameter 𝛽for semiconductors to viscosity of
the electron gas [216, 341], while solid-state physicists claim that viscous electron transport
has been elusive and was first observed in graphene, see Ref. [346]. In the future, it would be
interesting to do both electron transport and optical measurements on the same tunable plasmonic
semiconductor systems, since the viscosity of the electron gas should affect both.
Comparing optical with EELS measurements. Above we discussed that the hydrodynamic
Drude model could be used to explain nonlocal response in measurements on thin semiconductor
films, while in some EELS measurements the HDM was inadequate, clearly not as accurate as a
Boltzmann–Mermin model [338]. It would be worthwhile to explore the limits of the HDM, by
doing combinations of optical and EELS measurements on the same planar structures.
Concluding remarks
Here we have given an overview of some predictions and observations of nonlocal effects in
plasmonic semiconductors, both in linear and nonlinear optics, and listed some challenges,
opportunities and suggestions for future research.

Nonlocality in polar dielectrics
SIMONE DE LIBERATO
Current status
Phonon polaritons, hybrid modes formed by the strong coupling of electromagnetic fields with
optical phonons in polar crystals, have emerged as a powerful platform for sub-diffractional
mid-infrared (mid-IR) photonics. Unlike plasmons, which rely on free carrier oscillations and
can suffer from high losses, phonon polaritons benefit from the intrinsic low-loss nature of lattice
vibrations. As such, they have found application in a range of areas including sensing, nonlinear
optics and thermal emitters [347]. The standard approach to modeling polar crystals relies on a
local dielectric approximation, which implicitly assumes a negligible momentum dependence of
the phonon response. This local treatment works well at larger feature sizes, as in bulk transverse
optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons have well-defined frequencies at optical
wavelengths, separated by the Reststrahlen band. However, at the nanoscale, extreme light
confinement can probe the phonon dispersion well inside the Brillouin zone, phonons acquire
a non-negligible wavevector dependence, and their propagation within a confined geometry
cannot be neglected. Under these conditions nonlocal effects, where the material response at
a given point depends on fields in a finite surrounding region, become significant. Studying
the electrodynamics of the system requires then taking into account the phononic, mechanical
degrees of freedom on-par with the electromagnetic ones. This boils down to the Poynting
vector, describing energy fluxes, acquiring a second term, proportional to the stress tensor of
the lattice and describing energy propagating in the form of elastic energy in the solid [348].
Imposing the continuity of such a generalized Poynting vector allows one to determine boundary
conditions on the mechanical fields that, together with the usual Maxwell boundary conditions,
make it possible to fully solve the coupled light-matter problem. One important feature of these
boundary conditions is that they mix longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom, leading
to a modified optical response and the emergence of novel excitations known as longitudinal-
transverse polaritons (LTPs), which mix both transverse and longitudinal character. While
nonlocal effects are known to be present also in plasmonic systems, and some consequences
of nonlocal phenomenology are similar in plasmonic and phononic systems, the origin and
consequences of nonlocality in those two leading nanophotonic platforms is fundamentally
different, as schematically shown in Fig. 19 [306]. Plasmons disperse toward the blue and
longitudinal plasmons, which only exist above the plasma frequency, cannot thus hybridize
with electromagnetically localized plasmon-polariton modes, which instead exist only below the
plasma frequency where the dielectric function of the metal is negative. Their interaction is
necessarily an evanescent phenomenon, leading to nonlocal phenomenology in plasmons being
limited to an Ångström-thin skin depth. Optical phonons disperse instead toward the red, making
the coupling between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom a resonant, propagative
phenomenon, leading to the emergence of LTPs, and enhancing by of orders of magnitude the
length scales on which nonlocal phenomena can be observed and exploited. The existence of
LTPs have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in silicon carbide (SiC)
nanopillar arrays [349] and in crystal hybrids, polar superlattices with nanometric-sized layers in
which standard dielectric modeling fails to reproduce even the qualitative features of experimental
reflectance [306]. This success highlights that nonlocality in phonon polariton systems is not a
theoretical curiosity but a practical concern that can affect device design and operation. Other
predicted impacts of nonlocality on phonon polariton systems are an increased linewidth of
Fröhlich resonances in dielectric nanoparticles [306] and the reduction of field confinement in
nanogap resonators [350], as in both cases energy can leak out via emission of LO phonons.

Challenges and opportunities
As the length scales of photonic devices approach the phonon propagation length, phonon
nonlocality introduces several fundamental and practical challenges. The first and perhaps
most direct challenge lies in accurate theoretical modeling. Traditional modeling approaches
rely on local dielectric functions fitted to bulk optical constants, which fail to capture the
momentum-dependent response of optical phonons. As a result, standard simulation tools and
design methodologies yield inaccurate predictions of device resonance frequencies, confinement
factors, and field enhancements. This discrepancy complicates the design of ultra-thin and
deeply subwavelength structures where the effects of nonlocality are most pronounced. Multiple
approaches have been explored, taking explicitly the phononic field into account either in
finite-element method (FEM) simulations [350] or in scattering-matrix codes [351], relying on
effective medium theories [352], or developing analytical mappings to well-known quantum
optics models [353]. Still, these methods have been applied to relatively simple materials and

the frequency region spanned by the dispersive mode for real values of the wavevector

region overlaps with the region of negative dielectric function in which the Fröhlich
resonance can exist, leading to resonant energy exchange and to a substantially larger
nonlocal length scale ℓnl. Data adapted from Ref. [306].

interfaces, with the most complex case a single asymmetric Reststrahlen band in Ref. [351]. For
more complex and potentially highly anisotropic materials, in which multiple phonon modes
are present in overlapping Reststrahlen bands, the resulting set of coupled boundary conditions
could be substantially more challenging to solve. Even for simple materials current approaches
rely on approximations which limit the theory’s overall domain of applicability. For a start, all
the theoretical development cited rely on a quadratic approximation of the phonon dispersion.
This means that the frequency of each optical phonon mode is written as a function of the
wavevector as 𝜔(𝑘) =
√︁
𝜔2(0) −𝛽2𝑘2, where 𝜔(0) and 𝛽are the zone-center frequency and
velocity parameter of the mode. This can be problematic when considering interfaces between
materials with Reststrahlen bands with broad overlaps, in which the frequencies provided by the
quadratic approximation can diverge significantly from their physical values. While a completely
numerical approach that takes as input a parametrization of the phonon dispersion across all
the Brillouin zone could in-principle be used to solve the problem in a more general way, this
remains an open problem. Moreover, for extremely small nanolayers (1–2 nm), the microscopic
crystal structure starts to play a role, and the thickness of the each layer, used a parameter in
the dielectric continuum modeling, is not precisely defined. This adds a material-dependent
adjustable parameter to the theory which could be fixed (once each material interface) by ab
initio simulations [306]. A second challenge is related to experimental characterization. Probing
nonlocal phonon effects requires techniques capable of exploring few-nanometer scales, where
these phenomena manifest. While various mature approaches to near-field microscopy exist,
the dependency of the nonlocal effects on the exact dimensions of the objects requires samples
with extremely high uniformity, or the capability to probe a single nano-object, which remains
to-date challenging. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities that nonlocal phonon effects unlock
are significant. Nonlocality offers a pathway to create novel types of hybrid modes like LTPs
which combine the radiative nature of transverse fields and the strong interactions with electrical
currents of longitudinal phonons, potentially bridging the gap between electrical excitations and
far-field mid-IR emission. Such a capability could enable direct electrical pumping of mid-IR
phonon polariton modes, offering a route to electrically driven emitters without the need for
engineered electronic transitions such as those in quantum cascade structures. In such a scheme,
the Fröhlich interaction, responsible for LO-phonon emission in polar dielectrics, can become
dressed by the strong interaction crating the LTPs. The scattering of a conduction electron would
then resonantly create an LTP which could subsequently decay emitting mid-infrared light in
the far-field. While initial theoretical analysis shows this mechanism to be potentially intense
enough for practical applications [354], the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem makes
it difficult to obtain precise results and an experimental verification of the emission mechanism
is still missing. Only recently some more advanced non-equilibrium results obtained with a
non-equilibrium Green function approach have appeared [355] and still only for simple structures
and low values of the applied bias. Additionally, nonlocal responses could be used to enhance
control over optical anisotropy and hyperbolicity in polar materials. By carefully designing
nanostructured heterostructures, superlattices, and patterned nanophotonic elements, it may be
possible to engineer the dispersion of phonons and thus the properties of the resulting polaritons.
This could lead to enhanced sensing capabilities, ultra-confined modes with engineered dispersion,
and new opportunities for nonlinear optical processes.
Future developments to address challenges
To effectively harness phonon nonlocality, the next years will likely see a concerted effort along
two main axes: theoretical modeling and experimental characterization. From a theoretical
standpoint, developing comprehensive and user-friendly computational frameworks that include
phonon dispersion and satisfy both electromagnetic and mechanical boundary conditions is a
priority. Existing macroscopic models, some already demonstrated in simplified geometries,
69


===== PAGE 70 =====
must be extended and made accessible to a broad community. Incorporating nonlocality into
commercial electromagnetic simulation packages will be an important milestone, facilitating
widespread exploration. Such models should be flexible enough to handle complex anisotropic
materials, arbitrary nanostructures, and large-scale integrated photonic devices. On a fundamental
level, more intuitive analytical approaches to interpret nonlocal behavior and guide rational
design strategies will also prove valuable.
Advanced multi-scale modeling of LTP-based
electroluminescent devices will have to advance, allowing to better guide the design of prototype
devices to gain a first experimental proof of this novel electroluminescence emission channel.
Experimentally, there is a need for the characterization of more LTP materials, which will play
the double role of both verifying and pushing forward theoretical developments. Spectroscopic
characterization of monodisperse polar nanosphere of decreasing dimension could provide
evidence for some of the yet unobserved predictions of the nonlocal theory as well as clarifying
the behavior of materials below critical nanometer dimensions. Experiments are necessary to try
and observe LTP electroluminescence. Only after a first unequivocal observation of this emission
channel an effort to optimize the emission and collection efficiency could take place, which in
turn will be necessary to ascertain whether LTP electroluminescence is at most an interesting
curiosity or if it has the potential to empower a novel generation of mid-infrared optoelectronic
devices. Finally, synergy with other fields—such as ultrafast optics, quantum photonics, and
topological photonics—may lead to novel concepts and applications. For instance, the interplay
of nonlocal phonon effects with coherent control schemes or coupling to quantum emitters (like
defects in diamonds, molecular vibrations or quantum wells) could yield unprecedented control
over mid-IR light–matter interactions. Similarly, integrating nonlocal phononic elements into
topological platforms might provide robust, loss-resistant channels for infrared light. In short,
the future developments needed to address the challenges posed by phonon nonlocality involve
building a comprehensive toolkit encompassing theory, experiment, and device engineering.
These advances will enable the community to fully realize the potential of nonlocal phonon
polaritons in creating next-generation mid-IR photonic technologies.
Concluding remarks
Phonon nonlocality represents both a theoretical and technological frontier in mid-infrared
photonics. By moving beyond the local dielectric approximation, we acknowledge the true
complexity of polar materials and unlock new phenomena such as longitudinal-transverse
polaritons. Although this introduces modeling challenges and demands more refined experimental
techniques, it could open up the possibility of creating more compact, efficient, and versatile
mid-IR devices. The ability to couple electrical currents directly to radiative modes, leverage
nonlocal effects for enhanced field confinement, and engineer the phonon dispersion through
nanostructuring and heterostructures suggests a rich landscape of future innovations.
As
theoretical tools mature and integrate with experimental platforms, and as fabrication techniques
continue to improve, phonon-based nonlocal photonics will likely play an increasingly important
role. Ultimately, this may enable a new generation of mid-IR emitters, detectors, sensors, and
nonlinear optical devices that harness the full power of phonon physics and broaden the scope of
photonic materials and metamaterials research.

Nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
P. A. D. GONÇALVES

Current status
Plasmons in graphene and graphene-based nanostructures possess extraordinary properties,
featuring deeply subwavelength field confinement (𝜆𝑝≪𝜆0, where𝜆𝑝and𝜆0 denote the graphene-

===== PAGE 71 =====
plasmon and photon wavelengths, respectively), relatively low losses, and active tunability through
electrostatic gating [356,357] and exposure to magnetic fields [358]. Graphene plasmonics evolved
into a field of its own, fueled by the demonstration of gate-tunable plasmons that combine high
confinement with low losses [359,360], an exceptional performance as ultrasensitive biochemical
sensors [361], strong nonlinearities promoted by graphene plasmons [362], and potential for
the design of quantum optoelectronic circuitry [363], just to mention a few. Additionally, and
arguably just as important, the accelerated growth of graphene plasmonics played a pivotal role
in paving the way for the broader field of two-dimensional (2D) polaritonics in atomically thin
materials and related van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures [364].
In addition to their remarkable plasmonic properties, graphene plasmons (GPs) can exhibit
strong signatures of nonlocal effects (i.e., arising from the material’s 𝑞-dependent response,
where 𝑞is the in-plane plasmon wave vector), in contrast to plasmons in three-dimensional
(3D) or even ultrathin noble metals, where nonlocality is inherently weak and challenging to
probe—often requiring nanostructures with characteristic length scales in the few-nanometer
range [129,254,258], nanometric graphene–emitter separations [60], or the ability to measure
large momentum transfers [365]. The unparalleled susceptibility of GPs to nonlocal effects can
be largely attributed to two key properties:
1) Two-dimensional character and unique band structure. Graphene is a 2D semimetal in which
charge carriers behave as massless Dirac fermions, following a linear energy–momentum
dispersion. This enables on-demand control of the carrier density 𝑛(allowing for a
complete on/off switch of graphene’s plasmonic response) and, consequently, control over
the electronic Fermi wave vector via 𝑘𝐹= √𝜋𝑛. For moderate doping, the associated
Fermi wavelength 𝜆𝐹= 2𝜋/𝑘𝐹can take values of tens of nanometers (Table 1), which also
defines the length scale (e.g., for the plasmon wavelength) below which nonlocal effects
are important. Moreover, in finite-sized nanostructures, 𝜆𝐹can become comparable to the
system size 𝐷, making both nonlocal and atomistic effects appreciable.
2) Large optical confinement. Plasmons in graphene-based systems can achieve extremely
large wave vectors 𝑞= 2𝜋/𝜆𝑝, which can reach a substantial fraction of the Fermi wave
vector 𝑘𝐹, ultimately approaching the 𝑞/𝑘𝐹≃1 regime in graphene–dielectric–metal
heterostructures, thereby enhancing the role of nonlocality.
Therefore, the combination of large Fermi wavelengths and highly confined optical modes renders
graphene plasmons a unique platform for exploring the material’s nonlocal response. Beyond its
significance for accurately modeling plasmonic resonances in graphene structures [357,366,367],
nonlocal effects can also be harnessed to uncover many-body interactions encoded in the nonlocal
optical conductivity of this carbon material [93].

exhibit a 𝜔GP ∝√𝑞dispersion, just like any homogeneous 2D electron gas (2DEG) (although
with a different dependence on the carrier density, that is, 𝑛1/4 instead of the 𝑛1/2 scaling in
conventional 2DEGs) [356,368]. As the plasmon wave vector approaches a significant fraction of
𝑘𝐹, nonlocal effects induce a blueshift in the dispersion. At very large wave vectors, the plasmon
mode eventually enters the electron–hole continuum, enabling Landau damping [observed as a
pronounced broadening of the plasmon band in Fig. 20(a)].
Fig. 20. Plasmons in extended graphene systems. (a) Plasmon dispersion in free-

= 3.56. For graphene [in both (a) and (b)], the carrier density and relaxation time
are 𝑛= 1012 cm−2 (corresponding to 𝐸𝐹= 0.12 eV) and 𝜏= 500 fs, respectively.
In extended graphene, the large optical confinement provided by graphene plasmons can be
pushed to the ultimate limit in graphene–dielectric–metal (GDM) heterostructures [93,94,369].
In this configuration, screening from the metal at small graphene–metal separations significantly
alters the plasmon spectrum, reshaping it into a nearly linear dispersion [Fig. 20(b)] [93,319,370].
As a result, these so-called acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) attain even larger wave vectors
than those of conventional (i.e., unscreened) graphene plasmons at the same frequency. This,
together with the substantial slow down of the plasmon group velocity, makes AGPs particularly
susceptible to nonlocal effects [Fig. 20(b)]. Notably, Lundeberg et al. [93] measured the AGP
dispersion using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), revealing not
only significant nonlocal effects but also electron–electron interactions, including Fermi-velocity
renormalization and compressibility corrections. Furthermore, AGPs are capable of squeezing
electromagnetic radiation down to one-atom-thick regions [94,369].
The significance of nonlocality in graphene plasmonics is not limited to spectroscopic
measurements of nonlocal spectral shifts and broadening. The interaction between emitters and
graphene plasmons, mediated by near-fields with large wave vectors, presents a promising avenue
for probing nonlocal phenomena through their influence on emitter dynamics and emission
spectra. In particular, graphene plasmons have been predicted to enhance otherwise "forbidden"
light–matter interactions—e.g., multipolar transitions, two-plasmon spontaneous emission, and
72


===== PAGE 73 =====
singlet-to-triplet transitions—by several orders of magnitude [371]. For instance, in the presence
of large confinement factors (𝜆0/𝜆𝑝or 𝑞/𝑘0) achievable with AGPs, an atomic transition
involving a change in angular momentum of Δ𝑙= 5 (a 5th-order electric multipole transition) can
occur at a rate exceeding that of a dipole-allowed transition (Δ𝑙= 1) for the same atom in free
space [371]. In this regime, accounting for nonlocal effects is not just important, but essential
for rigorously describing plasmon–emitter interactions mediated by strongly confined graphene
plasmons [371,372].
Additionally, the unconventional Dirac-cone electronic dispersion of graphene gives rise to a
large intrinsic nonlinear response. Combined with the strong field confinement and enhancement
associated with graphene plasmons, this makes graphene an attractive platform for nonlinear
optics [362]. This potential can be leveraged to develop all-optical nanophotonic devices and
implement quantum gates [363, 373]. Incidentally, although graphene is a centrosymmetric
material and, thus, not expected to exhibit second-order nonlinearities, the tightly confined
graphene plasmons can give rise to spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. These
interactions make the second-order response finite, with the corresponding coupling strength
scaling as ∼(𝑞/𝑘𝐹)7/4 [168].
In graphene nanostructures—such as ribbons and disks—nonlocal effects can be particularly
pronounced due to the additional localization provided by the finite lateral size (i.e., the structure
acts as a resonant cavity). This results in plasmon resonances with wavelength comparable to
the characteristic system size 𝜆𝑝∼𝐷, and introduces an effective wave vector 𝑞∼𝐷−1. As
mentioned earlier, and as shown in Table 1, the Fermi wavelength can satisfy 𝜆𝐹∼{𝜆𝑝, 𝐷} for
commonly used carrier densities. At low carrier concentrations, where 𝜆𝐹≳100 nm, nonlocal
effects are observable even in relatively large graphene structures. In small nanostructures
with significant edge-to-bulk ratios, nonlocality and quantum finite-size effects become closely
intertwined, as localized plasmon resonances can probe the length scales associated with electronic
edge states. Specifically, the type of edge termination—zigzag (ZZ) or armchair (AC)—leads to
distinct plasmonic responses in nanostructured graphene (Fig. 21) [366]. Figures 21(b) and 21(c)
show the plasmon energies and linewidths obtained through RPA calculations using tight-binding
eigenstates for different ribbon widths. The classically predicted plasmon energies agree well
with those obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations down to 𝐷≈10 nm. For smaller
ribbon widths, the atomistic theory predicts an increasing blueshift of the plasmon resonances
as the width decreases. Note, however, that while the resonance position is almost identical for
both ZZ- and AC-terminated ribbons (except for extremely narrow widths), the corresponding
linewidths are significantly different: the plasmon linewidths in AC ribbons closely follow
the classical result, whereas those in ZZ ribbons exhibit increased broadening for 𝐷≲17 nm.
This broadening arises from edge states forming a weakly dispersive band near the Dirac point,
enabling plasmon decay into electron–hole pair excitations for plasmon energies above 𝐸𝐹[366].
Unlike nanoribbons, graphene nanodisks cannot be constructed with purely ZZ or AC
terminations, inevitably resulting in mixed edge types (see inset of Fig. 21). Consequently,
their plasmonic response becomes polarization-dependent, as the termination varies along the
perimeter. This is clearly shown in Fig. 21(c), together with the observed blueshift of the plasmon
resonances when compared with the classical description. Additionally, the figure reveals several
weaker resonances, attributed to higher-order multipoles as well as hybridizations with interband
transitions (involving electronic edge states from ZZ-terminated regions).
For systems comprising more than one nanostructure, the Coulomb interaction between
neighboring elements leads to a richer plasmonic response [374,375].
In passing, we emphasize that, while in Fig. 21 the classical electromagnetic description
accurately predicts plasmon resonances in graphene ribbons and disks with 𝐷≳10–17 nm, this
threshold is not universal, as it strongly depends on carrier density. For the cases considered
in Fig. 21, with 𝐸𝐹= 0.4 eV (𝑛≈1.2 × 1013 cm−2), the corresponding Fermi wavelength is
73


===== PAGE 74 =====
𝜆𝐹≈10 nm, which aligns well with this threshold. Hence, at lower carrier densities, nonlocal
and quantum finite-size effects can manifest in larger graphene nanostructures.
Challenges, opportunities, and future directions
Graphene plasmonics is now a well-consolidated field from both theoretical and experimental
standpoints. However, nonlocal and quantum size effects in graphene nanoplasmonics remain less
explored, despite their significance for exploring the fundamental limits of plasmon-enhanced
light–matter interactions in graphene and for designing truly nanometer-scale graphene devices.
On the experimental side, many theoretical proposals have yet to be realized, including the
unambiguous observation of quantum size effects in small graphene nanostructures (down to
"molecular-sized" graphene [376]) and the exploitation of ultraconfined graphene plasmons to
infer quantum nonlocal effects in metals [319] and in strongly correlated materials [377]. While the
latter could be already pursued using current state-of-the-art s-SNOM techniques [93,360,378], the
fabrication of high-quality, pristine nanographenes on dielectric substrates suitable for plasmonics
remains a challenge, with stable systems still limited to crystallographically well-defined metallic
surfaces.
On the theoretical front, several promising directions remain open. In extended graphene,
further investigation is needed in the hydrodynamic-transport regime—the opposite of the
commonly studied quasi-collisionless scenario—where charge carriers behave as a viscous
fluid, giving rise to intriguing transport phenomena such as negative nonlocal resistance and
current whirlpools [379,380]. The implications of these effects for graphene plasmons remain

Additionally, graphene nanoribbons can exhibit spin-polarized edges and edge magnetism [384],
suggesting the exploration of spin-polarized plasmons [385].
In parallel, the growing interest in twisted moiré quantum materials is expected to extend into
plasmonics in moiré graphene. This field is already gaining attention, with the first experimental
observations reported [386] alongside theoretical advancements [387,388]. Here too, nonlocal
effects could not only shed light into the mechanisms governing the complex phases arising
in moiré materials but also open new coupling pathways where quasiparticles can exchange
momentum with the twist-induced superlattice reciprocal vectors.
Concluding remarks
Nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics arise from the unique interplay between highly confined
plasmons and large Fermi wavelengths, making graphene an exceptional platform for exploring
nonlocal phenomena. While often considered detrimental due to their association with increased
broadening, nonlocal effects can also be leveraged to access otherwise inaccessible phenomena—
such as nonlocality-induced nonlinearities and new coupling pathways—or to provide additional
insights into electronic correlations intrinsically linked to nonlocal properties.
Given the
advancements and future prospects outlined in this section, the outlook for nonlocal graphene
plasmonics is promising.

Nonlocal quantum gain, loss compensation, and plasmon amplification in
graphene hyberbolic metamaterials
ORTWIN HESS
& ILLYA TARASENKO
Current Status
Insight into nonlocal quantum gain represents a pivotal advancement in the development of
graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials (GHMMs), addressing longstanding challenges in
loss compensation and plasmon amplification. GHMMs are a class of hyperbolic metamaterials
(HMMs) that leverage the exceptional properties of graphene, a two-dimensional material
known for its high carrier mobility, tunable optical conductivity, and strong confinement of
electromagnetic fields [389–393]. Traditional HMMs use metal layers to achieve hyperbolic
dispersion [Fig. 22(a)], but these materials suffer from significant Ohmic losses and limited
tunability. In contrast, GHMMs replace metallic layers with single or multiple graphene sheets
[Fig. 22(b)], enabling dynamic control over optical properties while minimizing losses [393,394].
Hyperbolic dispersion is a key feature of these materials, allowing propagation of high-wave-
vector modes and enabling subwavelength confinement of light. These properties are essential for
applications in imaging, sensing, and nanolithography [368,395]. However, conventional models
for graphene conductivity, such as Drude and Kubo formulas, assume locality and linearity.
These approximations break down for excitations with large wave vectors, particularly near
the Dirac cone, leading to inaccuracies in describing plasmonic phenomena. The introduction
of nonlocal quantum conductivity models, derived using the random-phase approximation
(RPA), has addressed these limitations. These models account for both interband and intraband
transitions, providing an accurate description of the optical response of graphene [396–398].

This enables the calculation of regions of plasmonic amplification of waves, propagating in active
GHMMs, as illustrated in [Fig. 22(c)].
The chapter highlights the transformative potential of nonlocal quantum gain in GHMMs. To
theoretically grasp loss compensation and amplification in GHMM requires a nonlocal quantum
conductivity model [389,390,399,400]

Here, Π(𝑘𝑥, 𝜔) is the propagator of the electron-hole pairs. In RPA first order and expressed in

where 𝑛(𝜖) and ¯𝑛(𝜖) = 1−𝑛(−𝜖) are the distribution functions for electrons and holes, respectively.
Optical pumping of graphene introduces gain by creating an inverted electron-hole plasma,
facilitating stimulated recombination that amplifies surface plasmons [364,399–402]. This gain
mechanism not only compensates for inherent losses but also enables a shift from loss-dominated
to gain-dominated regimes of operation. Such dynamic tunability opens up new possibilities
for GHMM applications, including sub-diffraction imaging, efficient light-matter interaction
platforms, and quantum photonics [403,404].
Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of GHMMs to achieve low-loss imaging
and high-resolution performance in nanophotonic devices. For instance, GHMMs have been
integrated into subwavelength optical filters, tunable modulators, and plasmonic waveguides.
Their ability to dynamically switch between hyperbolic and elliptic regimes further enhances
their versatility [405,406]. Despite these advances, challenges such as gain stability, fabrication

precision, and scalability continue to hinder the practical implementation of GHMMs. The
field is now focused on overcoming these limitations to fully exploit the capabilities of nonlocal
quantum gain.
Challenges and opportunities
While nonlocal quantum gain has unlocked new capabilities in GHMMs, significant challenges
remain that must be addressed to realize their full potential. One of the primary challenges is
achieving stable gain mechanisms. Optical pumping of graphene introduces nonlocal quantum
gain by creating an inverted electron-hole plasma, but this process can lead to instability, noise, and
mode competition [403]. These effects arise when the gain exceeds a critical threshold, resulting
in uncontrolled amplification. Stabilizing gain requires precise control over doping levels,
chemical potentials, and excitation regimes. Without careful optimization, gain mechanisms may
inadvertently degrade device performance.
Thermal and collision losses also present a significant challenge. Graphene’s Fermi level
smearing at elevated temperatures and carrier scattering at high doping levels introduce energy
dissipation, limiting the effectiveness of loss compensation. These effects are particularly detri-
mental in applications requiring high field confinement or long propagation lengths. Mitigating
these losses will require innovative material design and system integration [407–409].
Fabrication challenges further complicate the development of GHMMs. The precise layering
of graphene and dielectric materials at nanoscale dimensions is technically demanding and
prone to inconsistencies. Current fabrication techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition and
atomic-layer deposition, show promise but require further refinement to ensure reproducibility
and scalability. Achieving uniformity across large-scale devices is essential for translating
laboratory advances into practical applications.
Despite these challenges, the opportunities presented by nonlocal quantum gain are immense.
Amplified plasmonic modes in GHMMs enable enhanced light-matter interactions, which are
critical for applications in quantum optics, sensing, and nanophotonics [410]. For example,
GHMMs can serve as platforms for developing efficient quantum light sources, entangled photon
generation, and nanoscale waveguides. The ability to dynamically switch between hyperbolic
and elliptic regimes also makes GHMMs ideal for reconfigurable optical devices, including
modulators, filters, and frequency-selective surfaces.
Another exciting opportunity lies in extending the operational bandwidth of GHMMs. Nonlocal
quantum gain enables the propagation of high-wave-vector modes, which can be harnessed for
broadband plasmonic devices. This is particularly relevant in applications such as super-resolution
imaging, where GHMMs can overcome the diffraction limit and achieve unparalleled spatial
resolution. Moreover, hybrid systems combining GHMMs with complementary materials, such as
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), can further enhance
device performance and introduce new functionalities [364,404].
Future Developments to Address Challenges
To address the challenges facing GHMMs, significant advancements are needed in material
engineering, device design, and fabrication techniques. One of the most promising avenues is
the optimization of gain mechanisms. This involves tailoring doping levels, chemical potentials,
and excitation regimes to maximize electron-hole recombination while minimizing noise and
instability [411]. Advances in laser excitation techniques and chemical functionalization could
enable precise control over carrier dynamics, enhancing the stability and efficiency of plasmon
amplification.
Thermal and collision losses can be mitigated by exploring new materials and hybrid structures.
For example, integrating graphene with high-thermal-conductivity materials, such as hBN, can
help dissipate heat more effectively. Similarly, introducing nanostructured dielectric layers or
77


===== PAGE 78 =====
low-scattering materials into GHMMs can reduce energy dissipation and enhance performance
under realistic conditions [393,402].
Innovations in fabrication techniques will also be crucial. Emerging technologies such as 3D
nanoscale printing, machine learning-assisted design, and layer-by-layer assembly hold promise
for improving precision, reproducibility, and scalability. These approaches could enable the
mass production of GHMMs with consistent optical and electronic properties, facilitating their
integration into existing photonic and electronic platforms [404].
Hybrid systems represent another promising direction for future development. Combining
GHMMs with complementary materials, such as perovskites or TMDs, can address losses while
introducing new functionalities, such as enhanced light absorption or tailored optical responses.
These hybrid systems could leverage the unique properties of each material to create devices
with superior efficiency and versatility [364,403].
In the longer term, GHMMs are expected to play a transformative role in quantum technologies.
By leveraging nonlocal quantum gain, researchers can develop advanced platforms for single-
photon generation, entangled photon sources, and low-loss quantum waveguides.
These
capabilities will be critical for advancing quantum communication, sensing, and computing.
Ultimately, the goal is to develop energy-efficient, ambient-compatible plasmonic devices that
can operate reliably across diverse applications. Overcoming the current limitations will require
a multidisciplinary approach, combining advances in materials science, device engineering, and
theoretical modeling. By addressing these challenges, GHMMs could become foundational
components of next-generation photonic and optoelectronic technologies [30,389].
Concluding remarks
The advancements in our understanding leading to non-local quantum gain have established
graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials (GHMMs) as a promising solution to overcome the
intrinsic limitations of traditional hyperbolic metamaterials. By leveraging the unique properties
of graphene and incorporating precise models of non-local quantum conductivity, GHMMs have
demonstrated their potential to address critical challenges such as loss compensation and plasmon
amplification. These innovations have enabled significant breakthroughs in nanophotonics,
quantum technologies, and advanced imaging systems [364,389,392].
The key takeaway from the discussed work is the role of nonlocal quantum gain in mitigating
losses and amplifying plasmonic modes, thereby enhancing the overall performance of GHMMs.
This is achieved through the optical pumping of graphene, which facilitates stimulated electron-
hole recombination and unlocks new operational regimes. As a result, GHMMs offer tunable and
dynamically reconfigurable properties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications,
including quantum emitters, nanoscale waveguides, and low-loss photonic devices [395,404].
Despite these advances, the field faces several challenges, such as achieving stable gain,
reducing thermal and collision losses, and overcoming fabrication limitations. Addressing
these issues will require multidisciplinary efforts in materials science, device engineering, and
theoretical modeling. The development of hybrid systems, integration with complementary
materials, and the use of advanced fabrication techniques are promising pathways to mitigate
these challenges [393,403,406].
Looking ahead, GHMMs are poised to play a transformative role in next-generation technologies.
Their ability to dynamically manipulate light at the nanoscale opens new frontiers in quantum
communication, high-resolution imaging, and reconfigurable photonic systems. Moreover,
the integration of GHMMs into existing photonic and electronic platforms will enable the
development of energy-efficient, scalable, and versatile devices [402,405].
In conclusion, the realization of nonlocal quantum gain in GHMMs has paved the way
for substantial advancements in the field of nanophotonics. While challenges remain, the
opportunities presented by these materials far outweigh the limitations. With continued research

Surface electrodynamics of crystalline noble metals
JOEL D. COX
& N. ASGER MORTENSEN
Current status
The emergence of crystalline metals in plasmonics [412], which are often considered superior to
their polycrystalline counterparts [413], has stimulated substantial efforts in the synthesis [414–
416] and optical characterization [417, 418] of these pristine samples to enable demanding
experiments [86,419–421]. However, crystalline metals are also turning notable in relation to
their surfaces. In particular, surface science has long established [422] that (111) noble-metal
surfaces [Fig. 23(a)] host in-plane conductive surface states – often referred to as Tamm–Shockley
(TS) surface states [423,424] – governed by a free-electron-like parabolic energy-momentum
dispersion relation [Fig. 23(b)] and hosting a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) localized
to the very surface. The TS surface state is formally characterized by a surface conductivity
𝜎∥(𝜔, 𝒒∥), exhibiting both frequency and spatial dispersion. The impact of the TS 2DEG
can be seamlessly incorporated into electrodynamics by modifying the boundary conditions to
account for the surface conductivity. This approach establishes a connection to the Feibelman
surface-response function (see also Sec. 12 in this Roadmap), as 𝑑∥∝𝜎∥[194].
The surfaces of crystalline noble-metal particles are typically comprised of multiple facets
corresponding to the intrinsic crystal planes of the solid [425]. The facets are in turn the cause
for intriguing morphology-dependent and polarization-dependent plasmonic resonances [321,
426–428]. In contrast, large planar flakes are predominantly characterized by (111) surfaces
[Fig. 23(a)], although their edges may naturally exhibit other facets [417]. The conductive
properties of the (111) facet in crystalline flakes are now renewing interest in TS surface states,
particularly in the realm of their electrodynamic response.

Challenges and opportunities
The electrodynamic response of the homogeneous 2DEG (possibly embedded in general dielectric
media), and in particular its supported plasmon excitations exhibiting a square-root dependence of
79


===== PAGE 80 =====
the plasmon energy on the wave vector [429], are theoretically well explored. A straightforward
approach is to derive 𝜎∥(𝜔, 𝒒∥→0) using a Drude model within the phenomenological
relaxation-time approximation, employing a 2D electron density consistent with the common
Fermi energy of the bulk and TS surface states. A key challenge remains in gaining a deeper
understanding of the relaxation rate in the 2DEG and how it may differ from its bulk counterpart.
Turning to the plasmon excitations of the TS surface states, strong screening by the adjacent
3DEG of the bulk influences the plasmon dispersion [430], resulting in an acoustic-like relation
𝜔(𝒒∥) ≃𝑣𝜙𝑞∥[Fig. 23(c)]. This is analogous to the 2D mirror plasmons observed in graphene-
on-metal structures [93], but represents the extreme case where the separation between the 2DEG
and the metallic "mirror" approaches zero. This makes the phase velocity 𝑣𝜙even lower, leading
to longer wave vectors at the same frequency [Fig. 23(c)], posing a significant challenge for
experimental observation in near-field setups. Angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS) has identified 2D plasmons on similar surfaces [431,432], but with even lower phase
velocities 𝑣𝜙. This makes them even more tightly confined to the surface than graphene plasmons
are to a graphene monolayer [93,433].
In the context of the plasmonic response of the bulk 3D electron gas (3DEG), the surface-
response functions are modified by the presence of the TS 2DEG. In addition to the Feibelman
perpendicular parameter 𝑑⊥(𝜔), there is now also a non-vanishing parallel component 𝑑∥(𝜔) ∝
𝜎∥(𝜔, 𝒒∥→0) [194]. Thus, contrary to any other facet where 𝑑∥= 0 [194, 315], the (111)
surface of noble metals is characterized by 𝑑∥≠0 [321]. A compelling question arises: are there
any plasmonic signatures that could differentiate (111) surfaces [434,435] from other surfaces of
the same metal? For faceted noble-metal nanoparticles, the 𝑑∥thus varies among its facets, which
is predicted to reflect polarization-dependent responses for even the dipole resonances [321]. The
definitive experimental investigation of this phenomenon remains challenging, requiring precise
control and characterization of particle morphology and orientation on the surface, along with
accurate measurement of its polarization response, for instance, using dark-field microscopy.
Probing surface-response functions remains an experimental challenge [260], as their extraction
often relies on comparing computational spectra with and without surface effects, which in
turn critically depends on accurate experimental knowledge of morphology on the nanoscale.
An alternative approach involves electrically gating a single nanostructure, where strong bulk
screening confines added electrons to the surface, effectively altering the surface response while
leaving the bulk response unchanged. This method recently enabled the first modulation of
surface response in a single plasmonic nanoresonator [238]. While simple models qualitatively
capture these results [238,436], a more precise theoretical and computational description remains
elusive. In addition to rigorous determination of 𝑑⊥(𝜔) and 𝑑∥(𝜔) Feibelman parameters for
charge-neutral (111) surfaces and other facets with the aid of ab initio methods that account
for d-band screening, additional key challenges include understanding the mutual equilibrium
distribution of added electrons between TS surface states on (111) facets and nearby bulk states on
all facets of a nanostructure. While atomistic models and the random-phase approximation (RPA)
have been used to study surface-response functions of (111) surfaces [321], further investigations
with advanced methods of charged systems (contrary to the common charge-neutral scenario),
such as time-dependent density-functional theory, are needed. Consequently, the experiments by
Zurak et al. [238] outpace the current theoretical foundation.
Future developments to address challenges
To address the outlined challenges, future developments could focus on several key areas. First,
there is a need to refine theoretical models to gain a more precise understanding of the relaxation
rates for TS states and their differences from bulk counterparts. This potentially involves the
study of the coupling to phonons in surface-terminated systems. By enhancing these theoretical
frameworks, researchers can better capture the complexities of TS surface-state dynamics and
80


===== PAGE 81 =====
interactions with bulk states.
Second, advancing experimental techniques for probing surface-response functions is essential.
This includes innovating experimental techniques that improve the accuracy of measurements.
The highly confined acoustic-like plasmons of the TS 2DEG can be probed using scanning
near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) and electron spectroscopy techniques, though both
methods present technical challenges, particularly due to low signal-to-noise ratios. In this
context, recent ellipsometry-based characterization of the surface response offers an interesting
alternative [316]. The excitation of acoustic plasmons based on nonlinear wave mixing constitutes
another appealing possibility that exploits nonlocal and nonlinear light-matter interactions (see
Sec. 19 in this Roadmap). Here, the energy- and momentum-matching of impinging light to
highly confined polaritons could be achieved by interfering counter-propagating beams in a
second-order difference-frequency generation scheme, such as that used to probe graphene
plasmons from free space by Constant et al. [437]. Additional optical momentum can be provided
by coupling light from dielectric waveguides to highly confined acoustic plasmon modes. The
polarization dependence of the second-order nonlinear response at (111) surfaces [418] and
plasmonic field enhancement [438] can provide additional insight to characterize the TS 2DEG.
For nanoparticles, achieving greater control over nanoparticle morphology, orientation, and
polarization response characterization will be critical for obtaining reliable data on the effects of
surface response and in particular the electrodynamic effects of TS surface states.
Another crucial area is the integration of computational and experimental insights. Future
research should focus on designing computational models that can explain experimental results
with high fidelity, particularly in the context of gated plasmonic nanostructures. These models
and ab initio descriptions must address the equilibrium distribution of added electrons between
TS surface states and nearby bulk states, potentially allowing theoretical predictions to better
align with observed phenomena.
Additionally, further development of electrically gated single-nanostructure experiments will
enhance the understanding of TS surface responses. Exploring methods to dynamically modulate
and tune plasmonic properties in these nanostructures will yield new insights into the behavior of
plasmonic systems under varying conditions. In this context, the combination of electrical gating
with the AC lock-in technique employed by Zurak et al. [238] is a promising method to extract
weak spectral changes otherwise buried in noise.
Moreover, investigating the plasmonic signatures unique to (111) noble-metal surfaces
compared to other facets is vital. Identifying these distinct polarization-dependent resonances
can provide valuable information about the fundamental interactions at play in these materials.
Incidentally, for delafossite metals, recent reports of nonlocal electrodynamic effects in the
hexagonally-symmetric conducting palladium (Pd) planes of palladium cobalt oxide (PdCoO2)
reveal the importance of facets in the Fermi surface, suggesting analogous dependencies on
Fermi-surface facets in reciprocal space [439].
Furthermore, there is a significant opportunity to explore transdimensional plasmonics [440]
(see also Sec. 23 in this Roadmap), particularly the transition from three-dimensional (3D) to two-
dimensional (2D) plasmonic behavior in few-atom thin films subjected to out-of-plane quantum
confinement. In these circumstances, where distinguishing between surface and bulk properties
becomes less straightforward, it may be interesting to revisit Sipe’s selvage considerations [192].
Lastly, the similarities between graphene plasmonics and TS surface states could be advanta-
geous, as graphene plasmons may serve as a tool to probe and reveal quantum phenomena in
the 2DEG linked to TS surface states. For instance, Gonçalves et al. [319] proposed extending
graphene-on-metal experiments [93] to investigate the interplay between nonlocal 2D plasmons
(from both graphene and TS types) and their screening by the adjacent 3D electron gas of the
bulk metal, which also responds nonlocally [441, 442]. While impressive experiments have
utilized polycrystalline metal films [93,94], the change to crystalline flakes with (111) surfaces
81


===== PAGE 82 =====
may present a new paradigm when interfaced with graphene. The hybridization of graphene and
TS-type plasmons could pave the way for new explorations of quantum effects in highly confined
electron gases.
Concluding remarks
Crystalline noble metals, particularly their (111) facets with Tamm–Shockley surface states,
present opportunities to explore surface-specific phenomena, including nonlocal response
and refined surface-response formalisms. Progress requires advancing theoretical models for
relaxation rates, nonlocal effects, and their distinctions from bulk properties, as well as improving
experimental methods to probe surface responses with high precision. Greater control over
nanoparticle morphology and the integration of computational and experimental approaches,
especially in gated nanostructures, are key. Investigating surface-state plasmonic properties,
including their nonlocal behavior, and hybrid interactions with graphene plasmons could pave
the way for deeper insights into surface electrodynamics.

Concerted nonlinear and nonlocal electrodynamics in 2D materials
LINE JELVER
, EDUARDO J. C. DIAS
& JOEL D. COX
Current status
Nonlocal electrodynamic phenomena in nanophotonics have been extensively studied in the
regime of linear optics, where a one-to-one correspondence is maintained between the energy
and momentum carried by photons and the polarization they induce in matter. However, spatially-
extended nonlocal light-matter interactions become inherently more complex in the realm of
nonlinear optics, where the self-interaction of intense optical fields comprised of many photons
is mediated by their mutual strong coupling with matter. For instance, sharp variations in the
spatial distribution of near-fields can significantly impact the nonlinear response of individual
nanostructures [443], while engineered long-range interactions among subwavelength scatterers
in metasurfaces can give rise to a large collective nonlinear optical response [444–446].
The regimes of nonlocal and nonlinear electrodynamics overlap when high-intensity light is
confined on extremely small length scales, as summarized in Fig. 24(a). This situation is uniquely
embodied by polaritons—quasiparticles formed by the hybridization of light with collective
dipole-carrying matter excitations—in two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin or van der Waals
(vdW) materials. Here, reduced screening due to the vanishing thickness of 2D materials
pushes the near-field confinement of their supported polaritons to extreme levels [364,370,405],
leading to enhanced spatial dispersion and an intrinsically nonlocal response. In tandem, the
concentrated electromagnetic near-fields associated with 2D polaritons can effectively drive
nonlinear light-matter interactions that exhibit an involved dependence on both frequency and
spatial dispersion (see Fig. 24).
Although significant effort has been dedicated to studying the nonlocal behavior of polaritons
in 2D materials (see Sec. 16 in this Roadmap), such as through scanning near-field optical
microscopy (SNOM) imaging [93,360,447,448], most investigations have focused on the linear
response regime. On the other hand, studies of nonlinear polariton-driven light-matter interactions
in 2D materials have thus far been mainly restricted to graphene plasmonics [168,437,449–453].
Owing to its linear electronic band structure and atomic thickness, graphene plasmon resonances
that strongly confine electromagnetic near-fields can be induced and actively tuned by electrostatic
gating. The Dirac cone electronic dispersion relation of graphene also ensures that its free charge
carriers undergo highly anharmonic motion, leading to a large intrinsic nonlinear optical response.
These properties combined have motivated intensive research efforts in nonlinear graphene
plasmonics to leverage the highly confined and actively tunable 2D plasmons for applications in
82


===== PAGE 83 =====
nonlinear nanophotonics [362]. However, graphene plasmon resonances are generally limited
by achievable charge doping levels to terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) frequencies, and, albeit
longer-lived than their noble metal counterparts, suffer from substantial losses [360].
Beyond isolated 2D materials, nonlocal light-matter interactions become particularly important
in vdW heterostructures. In particular, interfacing a vdW material with a metal film behaving as
a perfect conductor gives rise to image polaritons, formed by the self-interaction of 2D polaritons
with their mirror image in the metal [454]. The extreme confinement of the associated near-fields
is characterized by an acoustic-like plasmon dispersion relation that extends well beyond the light
cone, making these so-called acoustic plasmon modes extremely sensitive to nonlocal effects. In
the case of metal/graphene hybrids, the deviation of their experimentally observed behavior from
predictions based on a local description allows these polaritons to probe the nonlocal response of
the combined system [441]. Although the strong near-fields associated with image polaritons
hold great promise for nonlinear optics, studies of these excitations have mainly focused on the
linear response regime.

material/metal heterostructure (inset), from free space through nonlinear wave mixing.
Challenges and opportunities
In centrosymmetric crystals, the leading contribution to the second-order nonlinear optical
response is proportional to the gradient of the electromagnetic field that breaks inversion
symmetry, and thus is inherently nonlocal [168,455]. While this symmetry dependence impedes
second-order nonlinear optical effects (e.g., second-harmonic generation, sum- or difference-
frequency generation, and optical rectification) in bulk crystals, it presents an opportunity to
control the nonlinear response by engineering spatially-extended light-matter interactions. This
concept has been theoretically explored in graphene plasmonics, where the resonant excitation
of plasmons in inversion-symmetric ensembles of graphene nanoribbons is predicted to drive
a large second-order nonlinear response when the inversion symmetry is broken by tuning the
ribbon doping charge densities independently [456], as illustrated in Fig. 24(c).

===== PAGE 84 =====
Meanwhile, the extreme near-field confinement associated with image polaritons in graphene-
metal heterostructures should give rise to an intense optical nonlinearity that is highly sensitive
to nonlocal effects. Preliminary results have been achieved with heterostructures of graphene
interfacing noble metal ribbons, where the broken translational symmetry of the metal ribbons
facilitates in- and out-coupling to the far-field in experiments on harmonic generation [452,457].
However, the large volume of metal in these systems presents challenges when attempting to
distinguish the metal and graphene contributions, and is problematic due to the large Ohmic
losses in noble metals.
Nonlinear optical effects can also facilitate the excitation of propagating polaritons in extended
systems. For instance, the difference frequency and wave vector produced by the second-
order mixing of intense counter-propagating electromagnetic fields can be tailored to couple
with the polariton dispersion extending beyond the light cone, as schematically represented in
Fig. 24(d). This concept has been experimentally demonstrated for graphene plasmons, enabling
the excitation of plasmons by free space illumination [437], as well as the optoelectronic tuning
of multiple waveguided plasmon modes sustained by a graphene sheet embedded in an optical
waveguide [453].
The combined nonlocal and nonlinear interactions of waveguided polaritons offers exciting
prospects for developing integrated quantum photonic devices.
In particular, propagating
quantized plasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to exhibit unity-order coherent
nonlinear interactions, including two-plasmon absorption [363] and 𝜋-phase shifts induced
by the collision of counter-propagating plasmons [373].
However, these schemes impose
demanding structural and electronic quality requirements on 2D sheets and nanostructures,
presenting a significant challenge to their experimental realization. Although recent advancements
have enabled atomically precise control over the width and edge configurations of graphene
nanoribbons [458–460], as well as in the fabrication of nanoscale transition metal dichalcogenide
(TMD) ribbons and tubes [461,462], scalable and robust production methods for polariton-based
devices remains a critical barrier. Addressing this challenge will require further development of
scalable fabrication techniques to fully unlock the potential of 2D materials in optoelectronic
applications.
Future developments to address challenges
The unique optoelectronic properties of atomically thin materials open numerous avenues for
applications in nanophotonics, while the strong field confinement of polaritons in 2D materials
beyond graphene can help overcome current limitations in graphene plasmonics. For instance,
the lack of crystal inversion symmetry in monolayer TMDs allows even-ordered nonlinear
optical processes to occur in extended samples, which can be enhanced by excitons with
valley-dependent degrees of freedom [463]. Although the low group velocities exhibited by
exciton-polaritons limit their ability to propagate optical signals, nonlinear and nonlocal light-
matter interactions in engineered heterostructures could alleviate this constraint while leveraging
the high exciton coherence for emerging technologies [464]. The directional dependence of
propagating polaritons in anisotropic 2D materials—such as plasmons in doped phosphorene
or in emerging vdW materials like palladium phosphoselenide (PdPSe) and arsenic trisulfide
(As2S3)—offers additional spatial control that can influence polariton-driven nonlinear optical
phenomena. Notably, As2S3 features a record high birefringence [465], further expanding the
design possibilities for advanced nanophotonic systems.
The greatest challenges for the realization of devices that harness concerted nonlinear and
nonlocal effects lie in the need for highly precise fabrication methods that produce defect-free and
well-aligned nanostructures while ensuring seamless integration with existing technologies. On
the theory side, advanced condensed matter and electrodynamic models that incorporate spatial
dispersion in the nonlinear response functions of extended 2D materials must be developed to
84


===== PAGE 85 =====
accurately capture nonlocal effects [466]. In mesoscopic 2D systems, atomistic simulations offer
a powerful framework to simultaneously incorporate nonlocal and quantum-mechanical effects
in the polariton-driven nonlinear optical response [467,468].
The creation of heterostructures that integrate graphene with other 2D materials offers
another promising direction for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic technologies. Such
heterostructures offer highly confined polaritons, exhibiting enhanced in-plane dispersion
and strong associated near-fields, and can leverage the high intrinsic nonlinear response and
optoelectronic tunability of graphene to explore nonlocal and nonlinear optical phenomena.
Future research could focus on graphene-hBN heterostructures, where hybrid plasmon-phonon
modes enable ultrafast nonlinear switching and low-loss waveguiding in the mid-IR [469]. The
exploration of graphene-phosphorene heterostructures will assess their potential for reconfigurable
and anisotropic photonics in broadband signal processing [470]. Furthermore, hybrid structures
comprised of hyperbolic 2D materials open new paths to engineer polariton dispersion, unlocking
multifunctional photonic platforms [471, 472]. Finally, advances in vertical integration and
interlayer coupling could lead to more efficient nonlinear optical devices with dynamic control of
both spectral and spatial responses.
Concluding remarks
While low-dimensional materials are ubiquitous in nanophotonics, studies of spatially-extended
nonlocal optical phenomena have largely been limited to the linear response regime. The intense
near-field concentration associated with polaritons in 2D materials presents unique opportunities
to explore the interplay of nonlocal and nonlinear light-matter interactions. To this end, novel
theory frameworks that incorporate optical nonlocality in the response functions of 2D materials
are needed to describe the complex energy- and momentum-dependent nonlinear interactions of
their supported polaritons. On the experimental front, advanced nanofabrication techniques are
required to create high-quality 2D material heterostructures capable of probing and leveraging
spatial and frequency dispersion in integrated nonlinear photonic devices.

Nonlocal chirality in twisted multilayer
MIGUEL SÁNCHEZ SÁNCHEZ
, DIONISIOS MARGETIS
,
GUILLERMO GÓMEZ-SANTOS
& TOBIAS STAUBER
Current status
Etymologically, the word chirality comes from the Greek word for "hand" and is thus related to
a three-dimensional object whose mirror image does not match the original by any translation
or rotation in 3D space. In reverse, this means that purely two-dimensional systems cannot be
genuinely chiral, since the object itself would serve as a mirror plane.
Chiral objects define two enantiomers which are identical in all scalar properties such as
density or eigenfrequencies. Nevertheless, in their interaction with other chiral objects, opposite
enantiomers can be detected. Circularly polarized (CP) light can thus distinguish left or right-
handed samples by measuring the different absorption cross-sections of left and right CP light
giving rise to circular dichroism (CD) [473]. Since linearly polarized light is the superposition
of left and right CP light, there will also be a rotation of the polarization plane. This has been
observed in neutral twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) for certain resonant frequencies related to
transitions around the van Hove singularities [474].
Polarization rotation and CD can usually be observed by breaking either time-reversal or
rotational/mirror symmetries [475]. In TBG, both symmetries are conserved, which makes
the observation of CD remarkable since Maxwell’s equations are reciprocal in unbiased two-
dimensional systems and there should be no dependence on the direction of the CP light. However,
85


===== PAGE 86 =====
there is a slight breaking of the two-dimensionality of the system as the two layers are separated
by a distance 𝑎= 3.4Å. In fact, the chiral response in TBG is due to the non-local correlation
between the current-density of layer 1 in say 𝑥-direction and the current density of layer 2 in the
(transverse) 𝑦-direction:
𝜒chiral(𝜔) = −𝑖
ℏ
∫∞
0
𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑖𝜔𝑡

𝑗1
𝑥(𝑡), 𝑗2
𝑦(0)

,
(61)
where 𝑗ℓ
𝜈(𝑡) is the 𝜈-directed current operator (𝜈= 𝑥, 𝑦) in layer ℓin the interaction picture, and
⟨·⟩is the equilibrium average. Eq. (61) provides the average current in layer 1 due to the electric
field in layer 2, and could be interpreted as the system response to the "gradient" of the electric
field along the third dimension [5].
The chiral response only depends indirectly on the distance between the two layers, 𝑎, via the
equilibrium average. However, typical chiral observables are directly proportional to 𝑎and thus
depend on 𝑎𝜒chiral [476].
The nonlocal response between perpendicular current-directions of different layers is not the
only requirement to observe CD, because for electron-hole symmetric systems the chiral response
is identically zero at charge neutrality. Only due to small electron-hole symmetry breaking,
electron-like and hole-like transitions are not compensated and the enhanced density of states
around van Hove singularities can give rise to an observable CD [477,478]. In fact, two main
resonances are observed in Ref. [474], related to transitions around two different van Hove
singularities.
Challenges and opportunities
To calculate the CD, one needs to go beyond the dipole approximation 𝑒𝑖𝑘𝑧≈1 + 𝑖𝑘𝑧, again
emphasizing that chirality is a three-dimensional phenomenon. This introduces the dimensionless
scale 𝑘𝑎, where 𝑎is the typical extension of the chiral object and 𝑘= 2𝜋/𝜆the wave number of
light. This scale is usually small making chiral effects hard to use in typical nanoscale devices.
Field-theoretically, the chirality of an electromagnetic field with electric field 𝑬and magnetic
field 𝑩in a dielectric medium with relative dielectric permittivity 𝜀and magnetic permeability 𝜇
is defined by
C = 𝜀𝜀0
2 𝑬· (∇× 𝑬) +
1
2𝜇𝜇0
𝑩· (∇× 𝑩),
(62)
which can further be related to a chiral flux via a continuity equation [473]. For CP light, the
chirality is proportional to its frequency 𝜔and intensity |𝑬0|2. For fixed wavelengths, the chirality
can thus only be modified by changing the amplitude which can be achieved by confining light.
In fact, decay into evanescent modes gives rise to fluorescence quenching which has been used to
detect chiral molecules with the help of TBG [479].
Also, surface-plasmon polaritons could enhance the chiral coupling and may enhance the
chirality up to 4000 times the one of corresponding propagating CP light [480]. Cavities
composed of TBG should thus offer tremendous opportunities as plasmon-induced near-field
chiralities may enhance photocatalytic processes for enantiomer-selectivity.
Quasi two-dimensional moiré structures can host plasmons which are inherently chiral [476].
Especially, many organic molecules are intrinsically chiral mainly due to the chemical structure of
carbon with its four valence electrons. In fact, all amino acids are chiral as only glycine is achiral.
Moreover, the RNA aptamer or Spiegelmer is chiral as well as hexahelicene and pentahelicene.
All these may be synthesized in an enantiomer-selective way giving rise to new functionalities.
Future developments to address challenges
The crucial requirement for the chiral response in moiré systems is the spatial separation
between the layers and thus the nonlocal correlations between the sheet currents. However,
86


===== PAGE 87 =====
increasing the layer distance would result in weakening the quantum mechanical coupling. Hence,
there is a trade-off between optimal coupling and large layer separation, probably best met by
transition-metal dichalcogenides such as tungsten diselenide (WSe2).
Another route to enhance the inherent chirality is to stack several van der Waals materials on
top of each other [481,482]. The chiral response of multilayers with width 𝑑should thus be
increased by the geometric factor 𝑑/𝑎= 𝑁, where 𝑁is the number of layers. However, the moiré
unit cell grows exponentially with the number of layers even for commensurable twist angles,
and for incommensurable structures it is difficult to obtain the electromagnetic response [483].
For the special case of alternating twisted multilayers, the analysis can be considerably
simplified as it can be mapped to independent twisted bilayers and one single layer in case of an
odd number of layers [484]. In Fig. 25, the multilayer moiré systems with 𝑁= 2, 𝑁= 3, and
𝑁= 4 layers are shown. The structures with an even layer number are inherently chiral, whereas
those with an odd layer number are achiral as they display a mirror plane at the central layer.
Nevertheless, even for 𝑁= 3 the nonlocal "chiral" correlations that involve the perpendicular
current densities of adjacent layers give rise to vertical gradients of the magnetic moment as a
response to an electric in-plane field [485]. This layer nonlocality in nominally "achiral" systems
could be detected by layer-discriminated contacts, as shown in Fig. 25(b) and also discussed in
(a)

whereas those with an odd layer number are achiral as they display a mirror plane at the
central layer.

Ref. [486].
Let us note that we can estimate the chiral response for moiré systems with arbitrary twist
angles between the layers using the decoupling procedure proposed in Ref. [484]. For that, we
rely on the fact that decreasing (increasing) twist angles can be mimicked by properly increasing
(decreasing) the interlayer tunnel amplitude [487]. Neglecting effects of non-commensurability,
we can thus map any multilayer moiré system onto a set of independent twisted bilayers and one
single layer in case of an odd number of layers.
Concluding Remarks
The nonlocal coupling between sheet-currents flowing the perpendicular directions gives rise
to a chiral response for neutral multilayer moiré systems without a mirror plane and slight
electron-hole asymmetry. Also for multilayer moiré systems with a mirror plane, nonlocal
"chiral" correlations can be detected by layer-discriminating contacts. These effects can be
considerably enhanced by non-radiative (plasmonic) modes leading the path to chiral cavities
composed of multilayer moiré systems with improved enantiomer-selective capabilities. The
functionality can be further optimized by tuning the twist angles and doping levels.

Strong spatial dispersion in metamaterials and metasurfaces
SERGEI TRETYAKOV
& CONSTANTIN SIMOVSKI
Overview
Metamaterials (MMs) are commonly defined as arrangements of artificial structural elements,
designed to achieve advantageous and unusual electromagnetic properties [488]. This definition
implies that metamaterials behave as effectively homogeneous media. This property distinguishes
MMs from photonic crystals and other arrays that cannot be homogenized and modeled by
constitutive relations for macroscopic fields. Structural elements of MMs, usually called meta-
atoms (MAs), as a rule, are small compared with the wavelength 𝜆and are arranged with the
interparticle distance which is also much smaller than 𝜆. However, some arrays of large or even
infinitely extent MAs (thin wires in a dielectric ambient or thin metal layers alternating with
thin dielectric layers), can be classified as MMs (hyperbolic MMs) because these arrays can be
homogenized if their MAs are arranged with a subwavelength period [488].
Among many parameters of meta-atoms that can be varied to design and optimize metamaterials
and metasurfaces, the key role is played by their sizes and shapes. Shape effects on electromagnetic
response of objects become significant when the object size becomes comparable (not negligibly
small) with the wavelength. Dependence of the material response on the wavelength is called
spatial dispersion. SD means non-locality of the polarization response. Understanding SD
and using its implications is in the core of MM science and technologies. The same refers to
metasurfaces (MSs) which are the 2D analogues of MMs – thin composite layers [489]. Instead of
bulk material parameters, MSs are characterized either by their surface impedance, or by effective
electric, magnetic, and magneto-electric collective polarizabilities, or susceptibilities [489],
which are in most cases spatially dispersive. SD, being a spatial non-locality, is manifested in
both MMs and MSs as the dependence of the material parameters (bulk or surface ones) on the
wavevector 𝒌. In the absence of spatial dispersion, metasurfaces cannot realize such important
functionalities as, for example, full absorption or reflection phase control, so that the possible
applications are basically limited to frequency-selective surfaces and some polarizers.
Weak SD is inherent to MMs composed by small complex-shaped MAs. It corresponds
to weak 𝒌-dependence of the permittivity tensor 𝜀(𝜔, 𝒌) which obviously depends also on
88


===== PAGE 89 =====
the frequency 𝜔. The first-order terms in the Taylor expansion of 𝜀(𝜔, 𝒌), linear in 𝒌, define
such effects of weak SD as chirality and omega coupling [488,490]. Among the effects of the
second-order SD the most important one is artificial magnetism [488, 490]. Both first- and
second-order SD effects are observed also in MSs [489]. For MMs artificial magnetism results in
the relative permeability being different from unity in the absence of natural magnetics. For MSs
this effect results in the nonzero magnetic surface susceptibility and (in the alternative model)
in magnetic collective polarizability. Chirality in both MMs and MSs leads to polarization
transformation and conversion [488–490]. Omega coupling results in asymmetry of reflection
(for both MS and MM layers in homogeneous space) [490]. More information about weak SD in
MMs can be found in Refs. [488,490,491]. Weak SD in MSs is reviewed in Refs. [492,493].
Strong SD corresponds to the case when the 𝒌-dependence of 𝜀(𝜔, 𝒌) is resonant [494], or its
Taylor expansion poorly converges, including too many terms [488]. Strong SD is inherent to
hyperbolic MMs [488, 494, 495]. MSs with strong SD are specially engineered so that their
nonlocal response allows the manipulation of electromagnetic field spatial distributions and
desired functionalities [492,493].
Current status of research
Currently, physics and applications of MMs and MSs with weak SD is a mature field. In
particular, there are well-established means to create and engineer resonant chirality for control
and optimization of optical activity dichroism. In addition to the use of chiral shapes, these
means include also the use of arrays of negligibly thin composite layers that are non-chiral in the
geometric sense (pseudochirality [490,492,493], also called extrinsic chirality). If an electrically
thin metasurface does not contain natural magnetic materials (like ferrites, for example), the only
mean to use it for full control of reflection and transmission is to invoke spatial dispersion. This
allows us to complement electric polarization of thin arrays with artificial magnetic response
of spatially dispersive structures and realize non-reflecting (Huygens’) and more general arrays
for control of reflection and transmission [489,492,493]. Omega coupling plays the key role
in realizing perfect anomalous refraction in metasurfaces [492]. Also, all electrically thin
absorbers covering highly reflecting bodies are spatially dispersive (omega) layers. Strong SD
effects in MMs and MSs have been also studied recently. It was found that strong SD in MMs
offers long-distance transmission of subwavelength-resolution images, super-Planckian thermal
emission and absorption and super-Planckian radiative heat transfer (see in Refs. [494,495]).
For MSs, strong SD grants strong coupling of propagating and evanescent waves and offers a
unique opportunity to engineer diffraction patterns [493]. Furthermore, full control of reflection
to realize anomalous reflection or focusing by MSs requires strong SD. Most recent studies begin
exploring new electromagnetic phenomena in time-varying media with spatial dispersion. For
example, phenomena at time interfaces in chiral media were studied in Ref. [496], and effects in
time-varying media with omega coupling are discussed in Ref. [497].
Challenges and opportunities
To design and optimize metamaterials and metasurfaces, appropriate modeling tools are needed.
As already discussed above, if SD is weak, there are well developed effective-medium models
based on the bianisotropic material relations. However, even the second-order effects are modeled
by these relations only partially, in form of artificial magnetism. Other second-order terms as well
as all higher-order terms enter the material equations with spatial derivatives of the macroscopic
fields [498,499]. Solving boundary problems for MMs and MSs with strong SD is even more
difficult. In this case, one needs to derive additional boundary conditions (ABCs) for each
particular MM microstructure [491]. In Ref. [498], ABCs were derived within a higher-order
effective-medium model. In Refs. [500, 501], ABCs were derived for hyperbolic MMs. For
media with strong SD difficulties arise not only in solving boundary problems. While for low-loss
89


===== PAGE 90 =====
bianisotropic media with artificial magnetism there is a general formula for the energy density
(see e.g. in Refs. [488, 490]), for media and MSs with strong SD such general formulas are
absent. In Ref. [502], the energy density in wire media (one of two known classes of hyperbolic
MMs) was deduced from microscopic consideration (telegrapher equations), and the results were
shown to be consistent with the effective-medium model (𝒌-dependent permittivity tensor). The
main goals of introducing effective medium models are to enable simple solutions of extremely
involved electromagnetic problems of fields in complex composite media and, most importantly,
get physical insights into the computed or measured results. Unfortunately, higher-order effective
material models become more and more complex, so that both goals become difficult to reach.
In view of these difficulties, it appears that direct numerical optimization of metamaterial and
metasurface structures remains the only available tool for development of advanced metadevices.
Significant efforts have been devoted recently to development of tunable and reconfigurable MSs.
One of the main envisaged applications is in future wireless communication technologies, where
tunable MS can be potentially used to optimize propagation channels in wireless communications.
As discussed above, only spatially dispersive MSs can offer full control of anomalous reflection
and transmission, which means that we need to develop effective and practical means to tune
non-local responses of MAs and their arrays or clusters electrically or optically.
Future development to address challenges
At present, research efforts in this field are focused on the design and optimization of MSs
for control of reflection and transmission, including focusing. In the microwave and terahertz
ranges the main envisaged applications are in future wireless communications (reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces). In optics, researchers envisage, for example, extremely thin MS lenses. As
discussed above, for any advanced control of waves, MSs must exhibit SD. Moreover, realizations
of the optimal performance often demand specially engineered strong SD. For MSs, this usually
means careful control of excitation and surface distribution of evanescent (surface) waves. Their
fields exhibit fast variations at the wavelength scale, which means that MA sizes should be
smaller than the wavelength scale. To realize such designs, technologies to create small, simple,
and cheap MSs need to be developed. To make reconfigurable and adaptable devices, the
properties of these MAs should be electrically or optically tunable in such ways that will allow
optimization of meta-atom couplings. To optimize parameters, it is necessary to further advance
numerical optimization methods, because fully reconfigurable devices cannot be realized as
periodic arrays, so that a global optimization of huge sets of interacting meta-atoms will be
needed. One possible route can be creation of standardized units (for each frequency range)
and pre-computation of basic electromagnetic parameters (such as impedance matrices and
effective antenna heights), after which fast purely arithmetic optimizations become possible [503].
Perhaps, some lessons from recent fast developments of artificial intelligence can be used in this
field. Here, concerted efforts of experts in electromagnetics and computer science will be needed.
To advance understanding and use of time-modulated (4D) MMs and MSs, very significant
theoretic research is needed. So far, only initial studies of time-varying media have been made,
mostly completely neglecting frequency and spatial dispersion. Studies of time-varying spatially
dispersive media considered only weak spatial dispersion, where it was possible to use the
bianisotropic effective medium model [497]. Moreover, always-present frequency dispersion
of spatially dispersive materials was so far modeled only in the low-frequency approximation.
Furthermore, no experimental studies of spatially dispersive media whose properties quickly
change in time have been made so far. Here, we would like to remind that a huge majority
of practically relevant MSs have significant SD! Many challenges are expected on this way:
First, time-varying spatially dispersive media need to be studied in time domain. While the
frequency-domain methods are well developed, this is not the case of the time-domain ones.
For example, to solve for fields at time interfaces, time boundary conditions are needed, and to
90


===== PAGE 91 =====
establish them, one needs to consider the microstructures of spatially dispersive materials. This
means that no universal boundary condition (like continuity of fields in the frequency-domain
theories) can be found. In summary, we expect seeing interesting and very much needed results
of researchers working in this area.

Nonlocal hyperbolic metamaterials and metasurfaces
SAMANEH PAKNIYAT
& J. SEBASTIÁN GÓMEZ-DÍAZ
Overview
Hyperbolic media, including hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) and metasurfaces (HMSs), have
driven groundbreaking advancements in photonics as well as in related fields like acoustics and
thermodynamics. Hyperbolic media displays remarkable electromagnetic properties arising from
its extreme anisotropy, hyperbolic dispersion, and field confinement. Such exciting properties
also entail that the media response depends on the properties of the waves that it is interacting
with, leading to larger nonlocal effects than the ones found in other media. Nonlocal responses
grow stronger with the confinement of the supported modes and appear due to the granularity
of the artificial media and the spatial dispersion of the composing materials – for instance,
the finite velocity of the electrons flowing in metals. To date, nonlocality has been mostly
considered a hindrance in hyperbolic media, and thus it has not been exploited to enable new
functionalities or to enhance device performance. This roadmap explores the interplay of
nonlocality and hyperbolic dispersion, highlighting both challenges and untapped opportunities.
The limitations of conventional local effective medium theory are reviewed, emphasizing the
need for sophisticated numerical tools able to solve general electromagnetic structures composed
of nonlocal metallic elements. These tools will guide the development of hyperbolic devices
in which nonlocality will be tailored to become an extra degree of freedom for wave control.
Future directions include merging drift-current nonreciprocal plasmonic, moiré physics, and
reconfigurability to realize tunable, nonlocal, and hyperbolic platforms with exciting applications
in multidisciplinary fields, ranging from sensing, signal processing and computing to acoustics
and thermal management.
Current status
Hyperbolic media [504–506] exhibits extreme anisotropy enabled by a material response that
changes sign as a function of the polarization of the electric and/or magnetic field and offers unique
hyperbolic dispersion together with an ideally infinite local density of states and wave confinement
[Fig. 26(a)]. Such features have driven advancements in ultra-high-resolution imaging, negative
refraction, beam shaping, optical sensing, and spontaneous or coherent emission enhancement,
among other applications. The electromagnetic response of hyperbolic media is limited in
practice by two mechanisms, namely the presence of loss and nonlocality, which close their
otherwise open hyperbolic dispersion relation and impose a wavenumber cutoff to the supported
modes. The lossy nature of frequency-dispersive materials is a direct consequence of causality,
and thus unavoidable in passive devices [5]. Nonlocality appears due to the granularity of artificial
structures and to the intrinsic spatial dispersion of the materials that compose them [507,508],
for instance, the finite velocity of electrons moving within metallic elements. Nonlocal media is
usually described as a wavenumber dependent and thus the material response depends on the
properties of the waves that are interacting with it. In addition to capturing the fundamental
response of hyperbolic media and imposing upper limits to the field confinement and local density
of states, nonlocal effects must be accounted for in the design of realistic hyperbolic devices and
exploited to enhance their performance.

Hyperbolic responses appear naturally in certain materials and crystals, such as silicon
nitrate, hexagonal boron nitride, 𝛼-phase molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) bilayers, or 𝛽-phase
gallium trioxide (Ga2O3) crystals, among others [509,510] and, as illustrated in Fig. 26(b), can
also be implemented by arranging subwavelength unit-cells taking advantage of metamaterial
concepts [504,505]. Hyperbolic media is usually characterized using local effective medium
theory (EMT) based on the Maxwell-Garnett approximation coupled with a linear response
model of the composing materials [504, 505]. EMT describes the hyperbolic structure as a
homogeneous media with effective parameters and assumes that the structural elements are much
smaller than the operation wavelength.
Intriguing, the response of hyperbolic media goes well beyond the predictions made by EMT.

To illustrate nonlocal mechanisms, let us consider that a hyperbolic surface composed of graphene
strips with periodicity 𝐿supports electromagnetic modes characterized with a momentum 𝒌and
a wavelength 𝜆. First, EMT remains valid only when the artificial structure can be considered
homogeneous, i.e., when the condition 𝐿≪𝜆is satisfied. As the supported modes becomes more
confined, their momenta 𝒌increases and their wavelength 𝜆decreases to a point in which they are
comparable to the strips size (𝐿≈𝜆). There, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 26(c), granularity
becomes the main nonlocal mechanism that closes the isofrequency contour of the supported
modes and imposes a cutoff wavenumber at 𝑘𝑐≈𝜋/𝐿. Second, the response of metallic materials
is usually modeled with local models (i.e., Drude local response approximation) that do not
account for the finite speed of electrons. As the wavenumber of the supported modes increases,
electrons might not be able to travel fast enough to follow spatial fields variations. This imposes a
wavenumber cutoff at 𝑘𝑐≈(𝑐/𝑣𝐹)𝑘0, where 𝑣𝐹is the Fermi velocity of electrons in the metal, 𝑐
is the speed of light, and 𝑘0 is the free-space wavenumber. The right panel of Fig. 26(c) illustrates
this scenario, confirming that the intrinsic nonlocal response of graphene becomes dominant
and closes the isofrequency contour when granularity is negligible. In a more general case, the
interplay between these two nonlocal mechanisms will tailor the media response. In general,
EMT is just an approximation and thus local predictions regarding infinite local density of states,
wave confinement, and spontaneous emission rate are incorrect. Figure 26(d) illustrates how the
presence of nonlocality limits the maximum spontaneous emission rate of an emitter located
near the graphene-based hyperbolic surface. It should also be mentioned that EMT might not be
accurate to describe certain type of artificial hyperbolic media, for instance in terms of predicting
the number of supported modes and their properties or accounting for polarization-dependent
inter-element coupling among the unit-cells that compose the structure.
Challenges and opportunities
Accounting for nonlocal effects in hyperbolic media is not an easy task. To accurately consider
the influence of the elements that compose the media, the most straightforward approach is to
solve Maxwell’s equations using full-wave simulations that account for both geometrical details
and the optical response of the materials involved. This powerful approach faces important
complications, including i) inability to incorporate nonlocal material behavior in most scenarios;
ii) lack of physical insight and analytical models that guide device design; and iii) requirement of
large computational resources. For these reasons, dedicated formulations have been developed to
model canonical nonlocal hyperbolic structures, including multilayered [411,511] and wire [512]
bulk configurations and planar metasurfaces [505,513]. Even though these efficient approaches
lead to closed-form expressions in certain scenarios, they are valid only under well-defined
operation conditions and cannot be generalized for arbitrary structures.
Another challenge is to develop nonlocal optical theories to accurately describe the material
response. These wavenumber-dependent models include phenomena such as quantum effects,
electronic transitions, and induced charge diffusion kinetics, among other, and have been
applied to metals [65], and particularized for materials such as graphene [514], and black-
phosphorus [515]. In this context, the hydrodynamic Drude model within the Thomas–Fermi
approximation [507,516] is a common nonlocal approach to characterize thin metals by employing
a combination of longitudinal and transverse waves that account for the electron dynamics.
An exciting opportunity in the field of nonlocal hyperbolic media is the development of
theoretical frameworks able to simultaneously account for the media granularity and the intrinsic
nonlocal response of its constitutive materials. The main challenge lies in incorporating complex
wavenumber-dependent material responses within electromagnetic approaches. Even though
some studies have already been put forward in this area [508,517] tools able to predict, model,
and tailor hyperbolic wave and plasmonic propagation in realistic structures would drastically
accelerate the application of this technology in practice. To date, hyperbolic devices have been

mostly implemented by relegating nonlocality to a mere hindrance. This strategy not only misses
the rich potential for tailored wave-control offered by nonlocality in hyperbolic media but leads
to complex implementations with sub-optimal responses.

Future developments to address challenges
Reconfigurable hyperbolic media has already been demonstrated in the local regime using phase-
change and correlated materials, revealing exciting potential for programmable nanophotonic
applications [522]. Tunable nonlocality has been explored in the context of current-driven
plasmonics, implemented using materials such as graphene [523] or ultrathin metals [524], in
which nonlocality appears because the supported waves effectively experience a different media
when propagating along or against the drifting electrons. Exploiting this phenomena, drift-biased
hyperbolic metasurfaces have been theoretically proposed [517]. In these structures, the interplay
94


===== PAGE 95 =====
between nonlocality and hyperbolic dispersion breaks the symmetry of the supported modes
in the 𝑘-space [Fig. 27(a)], leading to strong isolation and immunity to backscattering. The
experimental demonstration of such platform would provide nonlocal, tunable, and nonreciprocal
responses useful to control, collimate, and route waves with a performance well beyond to the
one found in common hyperbolic structures.
Recent developments in the field of twistronics and moiré physics have also enriched the
possibilities offered by hyperbolic media. For instance, it is possible to manipulate the twist
angle between stacked van der Waals crystal [Fig. 27(b)] to control their photonic and electronic
properties and engineer hyperbolic responses [518]. At the mesoscopic scale, such response
can be obtained by rotating hyperbolic metasurfaces that are located close to each other and
evanescently coupled [Fig. 27(c)] [518]. Even though these platforms have been considered
mostly in the local regime, nonlocality controls and bounds their fundamental response. Merging
drift-current media with moiré physics will open new and unexpected opportunities for tunable,
nonlocal, nonreciprocal, and hyperbolic wave control in which tailored nonlocal responses can be
spatially and temporally manipulated to enable applications in sensing, communication systems,
and computing, among others. Additionally, it would also open the door to the generation of high
𝑘-waves [525] and enhanced nonlinear responses [446] – enabled by relaxed phase-matching
conditions provided by nonlocality. These developments are inherently multidisciplinary and
can be translated to other fields. For instance, thermally engineered devices [Fig. 27(d)] and
nonlocal acoustic moiré hyperbolic metasurfaces [Fig. 27(e)] have recently been demonstrated
[520,521,526]. Arguably, the next step in these areas is the tunable manipulation of nonlocality
in both space and time, which would significantly expand the possibilities to radiate, receive, and
process acoustic and thermal waves.
In a related context, nonlocal metasurfaces have become transformative in the field of optical
computing, leveraging their ability to manipulate optical wavefronts in the momentum domain
with unparalleled efficiency [527]. Nonlocal metasurfaces have been mostly designed to interact
with light propagating in free-space and to provide tailored transfer functions in the momentum
domain (i.e., different responses versus the angle of incidence of the incoming waves) that
perform complex mathematical operations such as spatial differentiation, edge detection, or
Fourier filtering. A paradigm shift would be to exploit high 𝑘-waves (evanescent spectrum) for
optical computing. In such platform, illustrated in Fig. 27(f), input signals will be provided
by near-field emitters such as quantum dots or by capturing light coming from the far-field
using scatters and/or gratings. Nonlocal hyperbolic media provides unprecedented possibilities
to tailor their in-plane transfer function versus the incident wavenumber.
This paradigm
offers new and rich possibilities for optical computing and multi-functional devices enabled by
nonlocal processing of high 𝑘-waves that are not accessible in metasurfaces interacting with
light propagating in free-space. Many technological challenges remain to be solved before this
technology becomes a reality, mostly in terms of demonstrating tunable and nonlocal hyperbolic
field control. Moving beyond, the integration of nonlocal hyperbolic media with optical neural
networks and neuromorphic computing could pave the wave for advanced and ultra-efficient
signal processing capabilities over miniaturized devices.
Concluding remarks
While nonlocality has usually imposed constraints on features such as wave propagation and
the local density of states offered by hyperbolic media, it also provides an opportunity to
develop innovative strategies for tailored wave control. By advancing theoretical frameworks,
improving nanofabrication techniques, and leveraging emerging concepts like drift-current
media and moiré physics, the interplay between nonlocality and hyperbolic dispersion can
be exploited to unlock the full potential of hyperbolic media and construct nonreciprocal and
programmable transfer functions in the momentum domain. These advancements will address
95

existing challenges but will also pave the way for novel applications in a variety of fields, with
emphasis on optical computation using high 𝑘-waves, sensing, acoustics, and thermal engineering.
Exploiting nonlocality as an extra degree of freedom in hyperbolic designs marks a critical step
toward realizing next-generation photonic and multidisciplinary technologies with unprecedented
capabilities.

Overview
Plasmonic transdimensional (TD) materials are atomically thin metal, semimetal or doped
semiconductor films of precisely controlled countable number of monolayers [440]. Due to
current progress in nanofabrication techniques [528–531], such materials can be reproducibly
grown and offer high tailorability of their electronic and optical properties not only by altering
their chemical and/or electronic composition (stoichiometry, doping) or strain but also by
merely varying their thickness. While ultrathin films have been extensively studied, the optical
properties of TD materials remain somewhat underexplored. So far, the focus has largely
been on either purely two-dimensional (2D) structures including metal-dielectric interfaces and
novel 2D materials [532], or on conventional bulk materials, where the dimensionality and
composition are the primary factors influencing the optoelectronic response. Recently it was
proposed that ultrathin TD nanostructures provide a new regime–transdimensional, in between
3D and 2D, turning into 2D as the film thickness tends to zero [529–531]. In this regime, the
strong vertical quantum confinement makes the linear electromagnetic (EM) response of the
film nonlocal (spatially dispersive), and the degree of nonlocality can be controlled by the film
thickness [533–535]. This makes plasmonic TD materials indispensable for studies of the nonlocal
light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [534–541], where they exhibit extraordinary tailorability
including the capabilities of active tuning of their EM response and thus enabling new and
unique light-matter coupling phenomena [371]. In addition to strong dependencies on structural
parameters such as the type of substrate/superstrate and strain [542], plasmonic properties of
ultrathin TD structures show high sensitivity to external optical and electrical stimuli [543–545],
which could facilitate the realization of dynamically tunable ultrathin plasmonic devices. The
remarkable opportunities for tuning their highly confined in-plane plasma modes open access to
novel quantum, nonlocal and nonlinear optical effects [371,537–545] in both the near-infrared
and the visible ranges [543,546]. Over the past years, TD plasmonics has grown into a promising
research direction aiming to greatly enhance plasmonic functionalities through unparalleled
tailorability of confinement-induced nonlocal EM response effects [531,547].
Current status
The nonlocal optical properties of TD plasmonic films can be understood in terms of the
confinement-induced nonlocal EM theory built using the Keldysh–Rytova (KR) electron in-
teraction potential [533, 534]. In optically dense thin films of metals, semimetals and doped
semiconductors, the electrostatic Coulomb field produced by vertically confined remote charge
carriers outside of their confinement region starts playing a perceptible role with the confinement
size reduction [548,549]. The Coulomb interaction of such confined charges is typically stronger
than that in a homogeneous medium with the same dielectric permittivity. This is due to the
increased field contribution from outside dielectric environment with lower dielectric permittivity.
In the case of TD plasmonic films in a typical "sandwich" geometry [Fig. 28(top) with titanium
nitride (TiN) between magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium scandium nitride (AlScN)], where
96

the film of thickness 𝑑in region 2 is surrounded by semi-infinite dielectrics of constant permittivi-
ties 𝜀1 (top region 1) and 𝜀3 (bottom region 3), this turns the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion
potential in the film into a much stronger 𝑑-dependent KR interaction potential [548,549]. This in
turn leads to the 𝑑-dependent electron plasma oscillation frequency [see Fig. 28(top)], resulting
in the nonlocal Drude-like, in-plane EM response of the TD film [533]:

is verified experimentally in a variety of settings [529, 531, 539, 550] (Fig. 28). The theory
accounts for the vertical electron confinement due to the presence of the substrate and superstrate
of dielectric permittivities, which are smaller than that of the TD film. Importantly, the thickness
of the film becomes a parameter that controls its generalized linear magneto-optical response [551].
The nonlocal KR model covers not only ultrathin films with thickness smaller than the half-
wavelength of the incoming light but also conventional films with the thickness exceeding the
optical wavelengths [534]. The nonlocal EM response of TD plasmonic systems has been shown
to enable a variety of new effects, such as thickness-controlled plasma frequency redshift [529],
low-temperature plasma frequency drop-off [550], plasma mode degeneracy lifting [534], and
other quantum-optical [535,537], nonlocal magneto-optical effects [551], thermal and vacuum
field fluctuation effects responsible for the near-/far-field radiative heat transfer [538,539] and
Casimir interaction phenomena [540,541] (Fig. 28).

Challenges and opportunities
The confinement-induced thickness-dependent nonlocal EM response [Eq. (63)] of the TD
plasmonic systems provides the 𝑘-infinitesimal (first) order nonlocality type in the ultrathin
regime. It is dominant in the region of small in-plane momenta 𝑘≤𝑘𝑐, where 𝑘𝑐is the
in-plane plasmon cut-off wave vector, as compared to the much smaller standard 𝑘2-infinitesimal
(second) order type nonlocality. The latter is due to the degenerated electron gas pressure in bulk
metals described by hydrodynamical Drude plasma models [44]. The remarkable opportunity
to tune the first-order confinement-induced nonlocality through thickness-dependent plasma
frequency 𝜔𝑝(𝑘) in Eq. (63) is advantageous for applications of TD plasmonics in the fields of
surface and quantum optics and with regard to the development of extra sensitive optical sensor
technologies. To illustrate this, we refer to the TD-plasmonic-film-enhanced Goos–Hänchen
(GH) and Fedorov–Imbert (FI) shifts of a light beam incident on a metallic surface [552] [see
Fig. 29(top left)]. Both effects are known to depend on the incident beam polarization [552].
The GH and FI shifts are representative of TM/TE (𝑝/𝑠) linearly polarized and circularly (or
elliptically) polarized incident waves, respectively. Below we discuss the GH shift in more
detail [546]. Originating from the spatial dispersion of the reflection or transmission coefficients
due to the finite transverse size of the beam (and so nonlocal), the GH effect was observed in a
variety of systems including plasmonic metamaterials [553] and graphene [554]. In the reflection
configuration [Fig. 29(bottom left)], the lateral ΔGH and angular ΘGH GH shifts of TM polarized
incoming waves are given by [546]
ΔGH = 𝑛1 cos 𝜃𝑖
𝜕𝜙𝑝
𝜕𝑘,
ΘGH = −
𝜃2
0
2 𝑘0𝑛1
cos 𝜃𝑖
𝑅𝑝

𝜕
𝑅𝑝

𝜕𝑘
(64)
Here, 𝑘0 = 𝜔/𝑐, 𝑛1 is the refractive index for the medium that the finite cross-section (Gaussian)
light beam comes from; 𝜃0 = 2/(𝑘0𝑤0𝑛1) with 𝑤0 representing the beam waist; and the 𝑝-wave
reflection coefficient is written as 𝑅𝑝=
𝑅𝑝
 exp(𝑖𝜙𝑝) in the complex exponential form. It can
be seen that the spatial dispersion makes ΔGH sensitive to reflectivity phase jumps and ΘGH to
zero reflection itself so that large effects are highly likely for zero-reflection modes in the system.
Phase jumps and singularities make the phase ill-defined, and the reflection coefficient’s absolute
value must be zero as required by the causality.
The GH shifts in Eq. (64) are normally thought of as being due to the spatial dispersion of
the incoming light beam itself while the material EM response nonlocality is usually ignored.
For bulk materials or macroscopically thick films this is indeed the case. However, it is not
the case for the ultrathin TD plasmonic films where the strong vertical confinement makes the
in-plane EM response nonlocal as described by Eq. (63) of the KR model. We use TD titanium
nitride (TiN) as an example here, which is known for its exceptional plasmonic properties and
high crystallinity down to thickness as small as 1 nm [529,555]. Then, there is an additional
contribution to be taken into account in Eq. (64) that is proportional to
𝜕𝜀TiN(𝜔, 𝑘)
𝜕𝑘
= −
𝜀𝑏𝜔2
𝑝(𝑘)
𝑘(1 + ˜𝜀𝑘𝑑)𝜔(𝜔+ 𝑖Γ𝐷) = [𝜀TiN(𝜔, 𝑘) −𝜀𝑏]
˜𝜀𝑑
(1 + ˜𝜀𝑘𝑑)2
(65)
which is not only nonzero at finite d but can also be both positive and negative, depending on the
light frequency. It disappears when 𝑑goes to infinity–as it should to make the EM response of
thick films local in accord with the standard Drude model.
It was recently shown theoretically [546] that the confinement-induced nonlocality of the TD
films leads to topologically protected singularities of the nonlocal reflection coefficient. Such
singularities are shown to result in giant lateral and angular GH shifts in the millimeter and
milliradian ranges, respectively, which exceed greatly those reported for light beams of finite
transverse extent with no material-induced nonlocality [552–555]. The singularities appear in the
99


===== PAGE 100 =====
TD film systems with broken in-plane reflection symmetry (substrate and superstrate of different
dielectric permittivities), where due to the strong vertical confinement the eigenmode degeneracy
is lifted creating the points of the topological darkness in the visible range that do not exist in
the usual (local) Drude materials. Fig. 29(right) shows the topological darkness points (green
circles) that appear at the intersections of the non-degenerate EM eigenmodes of the TD film
system. The full analysis and the classification of the singularity points can be found in Ref. [546].
The remarkable opportunity to bring the GH effect to the visible range comes from the fact that
the nonlocal plasma frequency in Eq. (63) can be red-shifted not only by thickness but also by
in-plane momentum reduction through the incident angle change. Lateral and angular GH shifts
as large as ∼0.4 mm and ∼40 mrad, respectively, are predicted theoretically for typical 40 nm
thick TD plasmonic films, using for example the conventional helium-neon (He-Ne) laser light
[Fig. 29(right)].
Future developments to address challenges
While the experimental progress in TD materials for nanophotonics has earlier been impeded by
challenges in producing atomically thin films of noble metals, TD films of emerging plasmonic
materials such as transition metal nitrides (TiN, ZrN, HfN, etc. [555]) can be grown as epitaxial-
quality films with thicknesses down to 1–2 nm (5–10 atomic layers) [529, 531]. A variety
of transition metal nitrides, their ability to grow as high-quality, ultrathin epitaxial films and
the sensitivity of their optical and electronic properties to the material/structural/geometrical
parameters provide a rich playground for the realization of the confinement-induced nonlocal
effects. This includes using transition metal nitrides in TD plasmonics to control strong electron
correlations by precise variation of the film thickness to study fundamental solid-state physics
phenomena such 2D electron Wigner crystallization [547] and metal-insulator transitions [531].
Another important avenue to tailor the nonlocal optical properties of plasmonic TD films includes
strain engineering. Below a critical thickness, an epitaxial thin film is expected to retain the strain
induced by the substrate. This can be achieved experimentally by growing strained ultrathin
films on lattice-mismatched substrates. It has been theoretically demonstrated that by varying the
in-plane lattice parameter of an ultrathin film its nonlocal optical response can be tuned [542].
In conjunction with the thickness dependence of the nonlocal EM response discussed above,
the strain engineering offers an additional way to tailor the optical response of TD plasmonic
materials.
Concluding Remarks
Plasmonic TD materials hold great potential for enabling a new quantum material platform
that utilizes strong confinement and nonlocal effects and offers new opportunities for quantum
optics, quantum computing and sensing applications. A crucial step for such development is
the realization of high quality, ultrathin metallic films of precisely controlled thickness with
reduced surface roughness that exhibit new material functionalities and unique light-matter
interactions. The quantum effects that arise in metallic TD materials along with their strong
tunability may pave the way to new optical phenomena and novel, atomically thin, dynamically
tunable nanophotonic devices.

responses both in linear and nonlinear regimes. The optical properties of such discrete media can
be understood, in principle, through conventional local effective medium models. Comparing
these models with full-vectorial numerical simulations, however, shows intricate differences,
which are relatively small in general, but which become crucial for certain metamaterial
parameters, for which a local EMT breaks down, even in the range of its applicability. This
behavior is related to the so-called nonlocal, spatial dispersion effects which are not taken
into account in conventional EMT models (numerical simulations of a discrete structure of a
metamaterial however includes these effects automatically).
Nonlocality is a very peculiar property of optical materials, when the optical response of the
medium at a given point depends not only on the driving electromagnetic field at this location,
but also on the values of the field in other points of the surrounding region. This property is
not so common, and it is clear why. For natural condensed non-metallic materials, liquids or
solids, the optical response of an atom (or a molecule) is influenced by the optical responses
of its counterparts located only in its close vicinity, particularly at the distances of the order
of a lattice constant (or a molecular size), which is much smaller than the wavelength of light.
Consequently, there is no variation of the field over this region and it is a valid assumption
that this optical response of the atom is defined by the value of the field at its location. This
can be applied to any atom of the material, and therefore the optical response of the material
is local. The situation changes when larger quasiparticles are considered, such as excitons in
semiconductors, resulting in spatial dispersion which strongly influences the optical response at
low temperatures and leads to the appearance of additional waves [20]. The nonlocality of metals
important for the nanostructures with the size below few nanometers, associated with electron
spill-out effects and wavevector-dependent dielectric permittivity, is discussed in Parts I and II of
this Roadmap, including Secs. 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. A different situation can occur in metamaterials,
in which both the size of the meta-atoms and their spacing, although being smaller than the
wavelength in order to satisfy an effective medium requirements are noticeable fractions of it.
This results in i) field variation across the meta-atom, may lead to the excitation of higher-order
multipoles, thus affecting its optical response, and ii) the field at the positions of other meta-atoms
affecting the optical response in a given point starts to depend on their positions [556]. Thus, the
optical response of a metamaterial at a given location is noticeably affected by the field at other
points, naturally producing a physical mechanism of the metamaterial structural nonlocality. In
the reciprocal-space representation, this means that the optical parameters of the metamaterial
depend on the wave vector, i.e. the material is spatially dispersive.
With subwavelength structuring and the consequent absence of the diffractive effects, a
metamaterial can be considered as a uniform medium, which optical properties are defined by
the metamaterial design and can be described using effective medium theories (EMTs). In the
first approximation the metamaterial optical response can be considered to be local, but for its
precise description development of nonlocal EMTs is needed. This is especially important for
optical effects depending on the local fields inside metamaterial, such as photoluminescence
or nonlinearity, as nonlocality can create high nonuniformity of the local fields due to the
introduction of an additional wave. The development of nonlocal EMTs is not an easy task.
Generally, it requires deriving microscopic optical response of the metamaterial solving the
electromagnetic problem for the exact nanostructured design.
Then, within two common
approaches, the effective optical parameters, depending on the wave vector, can be found by
averaging the derived microscopic fields over the metamaterial unit cell, or setting trial (or
Taylor-expanded in the 𝑘-space) expressions for the effective permittivity and/or permeability
and matching the dispersion of the corresponding optical modes to that found in the microscopic
description [557].

Current status
There are numerous experimental demonstrations of the optical phenomena, in which the nonlocal
response of a metamaterial played the crucial role. As a prominent example, a metamaterial
formed by an array of aligned plasmonic nanorods represents a uniaxial medium possessing
record-high optical anisotropy, hyperbolic dispersion related to different signs of dielectric
permittivity along the optical axes, and an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response related to 𝜀∥≃0
(permittivity component along the optical axis parallel to the nanorods) [558] [Fig. 30(a,b)].
The presence of structural nonlocality, which can be derived using various EMT approaches
and approximations [557,559,561] fundamentally modifies these characteristics. In the local
approximation, optical extinction of the nanorod metamaterial layer features two peaks [located
at around 500 and 650 nm in Fig. 30(c)]. The short-wavelength peak, existing for both TE and
TM polarized illumination is related to the excitation of the transverse plasmonic resonance of
the nanorods, slightly shifted due to inter-rod coupling. Its long-wavelength counterpart, existing
only for TM polarized illumination, corresponds to the metamaterial opacity region near the
ENZ spectral point for 𝜀∥. The magnitude of this peak increases with the angle of incidence, but
in the local approximation its spectral position does not change with the latter. However, for low
ohmic losses of plasmonic metal, the behavior of the ENZ peak reveals a more intricate angle
dependence [559] [Fig. 30(c)]. Instead of a single peak, two ENZ extinction peaks showing an
angular excitation dynamics characteristic to anti-crossing of optical modes are revealed. They
102


===== PAGE 103 =====
are related to two TM-polarized modes, which result from the hybridization of the ordinary TM
mode with an additional longitudinal mode supported solely due to the metamaterial structural
nonlocality [559]. The latter, due to its dispersion characteristics and field distribution is optically
accessible only in the ENZ region. The presence of two TM-polarized waves in the nonlocal case
can be clearly seen in the plots of isofrequency surfaces [Fig. 30(d)] [560]. The nature of the
nonlocality here can be traced to the coupled cylindrical surface plasmon polaritons supported by
the nanorods [561]. The interaction of the hybridized TM modes and, therefore, the extinction
of the metamaterial in the ENZ region have been shown to be highly dependent on the optical
properties of the constituting materials. Active control of losses in plasmonic nanorods, e.g.,
through excitation of hot electrons upon light absorption or temperature effects [562] results in
effective switching the nonlocal response on/off by variation of the metal optical losses, leading
to ultrafast all-optical switching [563] and polarisation control [564] in the nonlocal regime.
The hybridization of the main and additional modes, the latter associated with nonlocal
response, in the ENZ region creates a very large effective frequency dispersion for optical pulses
transmitted through a metamaterial layer, which has been used to manage their propagation
and temporal characteristics [565]. Particularly, sub- and super-luminal, as well as backward
propagation of pulses have been demonstrated, with the switching of the group dispersion achieved
in the same metamaterial by just changing the angle of illumination [Fig. 31(a)]. Combining this
with nonlinear functionalities discussed above, one can potentially realize all-optical control of
the pulse characteristics.
Crucially, the structural nonlocality has a strong effect of the emission of quantum emitters
placed inside the metamaterial. The nonlocal description has been shown to provide a more
adequate description of the emitter spontaneous decay rate, contrary to its almost a singular
enhancement predicted by the local EMT [560] [Fig. 31(b)]. Experiments, together with the
microscopic numerical simulations have shown, however, that considering exact metamaterial
structure (as opposed to implementation of EMT theories) and particularly exact position of the
emitters with respect to the meta-atoms is important for correct understanding of the emission
processes.
Structural nonlocality has been also studied in multilayer metamaterials, produced by alternating
metallic and dielectric layers with nanoscale thicknesses, which share major optical characteristics
with the nanorod metamaterial, such as extremely high anisotropy, ENZ behavior and hyperbolic
dispersion. Nonlocality in these metamaterials is underlined by strong variation of the fields across
single layers (acting in this case as meta-atoms) [567], and is also affected by the inter-meta-atom
effects. It affects the metamaterial transmission/reflection properties, spectral position of the ENZ
region and the emission of quantum emitters placed in the vicinity or inside the metamaterial.
Particularly, Fig. 31(d) shows that the Purcell factor predicted by a nonlocal EMT matches the
numerically simulated counterpart in the limit of very small unit cell sizes, while the numerical
predictions agree well with the experimentally measured Purcell factor values [566].
Challenges and opportunities
From the theoretical perspective, various approaches have been developed to derive nonlocal
EMTs for metamaterials, starting from that assuming ideally conducting wires (relevant for
microwave frequencies) and wires having large negative real part of the permittivity (appropriate
for wavelength in mid and far-IR) to the models with no specific restriction made on the epsilon
of the nanorods (apart from the implicit assumption that they are metallic [559,561]). Commonly,
they return the same general dependence, featuring local effective 𝜀⊥components and nonlocal
𝜀∥counterparts, depending on the wave vector along the optical axis 𝑘∥. At the same time,
frequently models derived under similar assumptions results in different expressions for the
nonlocal effective permittivity, which motivates for comparison and generalization of the nonlocal
EMT models [557,568]. A related question here is determining an additional boundary condition

required for the additional wave. Substantial benefit would be the derivation of new or application
of existing models to define the range of metamaterial geometrical parameters which maximize
the influence of structural nonlocality and/or maximize the magnitude of nonlocality-assisted
phenomena, which would provide a valuable guidance for the experimental research. Of course,
all the above research directions are very challenging, as the derivation of any broadly applicable
nonlocal EMT, which should ideally satisfy several important conditions: i) provide correct
dispersion relation for the metamaterial modes, ii) give correct boundary conditions (note that
104


===== PAGE 105 =====
in the case of nonlocality an additional boundary condition is needed to take into account the
existence of the additional optical mode [561]), and iii) be valid beyond the case of plane wave
excitation [569]. At the same time, this means that there is a large scope for the future theoretical
research.
Experimentally, since the nonlocal response depends on losses of the plasmonic component in
plasmonic metamaterials, the realization of low loss material platforms (including 2D materials,
e.g. graphene) together with broader range of geometrical parameters will open opportunities
for realization and exploitation of stronger spatial dispersion contributions in a desired spectral
range for controlling molecular emission with potential applications in bio-imaging and quantum
technologies, and enhancement of optical nonlinearities, important for laser technologies and
optical information processing.
Future developments to address challenges
Nonlocal metamaterials have been shown to provide multiple functionalities, bio and chemical
sensing being among the most prominent. Usually, the sensitivity of resonant excitation of guided
modes supported by a metamaterial layer to the changes of the dielectric environment is used
for this purpose [558]. At the same time, nonlocal effects can also make the extinction of the
metamaterial in the ENZ region highly sensitive to such changes, through the same physical
mechanism as was considered above for the realization of optical switching. To demonstrate this,
samples with maximized structural nonlocality, achieved by engineering the design and reducing
the optical losses in metal, may be needed.
Apart from incoherent Kerr-type nonlinearity which exploit optically-induced heating of the
electron gas discussed above, nanorod metamaterials possess its coherent counterpart based on a
complex electron dynamics coherent with the excitation wave [570]. Particularly, it has been
shown that engineering of the modal structure of a nanorod metamaterial layer can enhance
second harmonic generation [571], while alternative approaches based on back-propagating
waves have also been proposed [572]. In this respect, developing nonlinear EMT including
phenomena related to structural nonlocality, e.g. along the lines presented in Ref. [573], would
provide a valuable guidance to the experimental research. Possessing an extreme anisotropy and
nonlocality which affect only certain components of the effective permittivity tensor, nanorod
and multilayer metamaterials present a particular interest for engineering light-matter interaction
with complex vectorial beams. An example here can be the study of interaction of the nonlocal 𝜀∥
component in the nanorod metamaterials with co-directed longitudinal fields present in radially
polarized cylindrical beams of various orders. Another research direction could be the study of
chiroptical, which have been shown to be inherent to the artificial media with effective structural
spatial dispersion [574].
Concluding Remarks
Spatial dispersion in metamaterials arises from sub-wavelength structuring and results in nonlocal
effects with electromagnetic fields depending not only on the field at a given point but also on its
variations across several unit cells. It is essential for accurately describing wave propagation in
complex media, including ultrashort pulses, and in particular the phenomena depending on local
fields inside metamaterial. It has much stronger impact on optical properties of metamaterials
than in semiconductors where it is related to the excitonic excitation and observable at low
temperatures. Recognizing spatial dispersion additional flexibility in the design of optical
response, it is important in advancing nanophotonic technologies such as, high-resolution
imaging, ultrashort pulse control, nonlinear optics, optical information processing and quantum
technologies.

Nonlocal wave phenomena in spatio-temporal metamaterials
ANDREA ALÙ
Current status
The last few years have witnessed impressive developments in the context of metamaterials and
metasurfaces, with remarkable progress in controlling electromagnetic wavefronts, and in the
application of these phenomena within a wide range of technologically relevant contexts. One
important breakthrough, detailed in several sections of this Roadmap, has been the discovery that
nonlocal wave phenomena are not necessarily just a nuisance, a correction over well-understood
phenomena in light-matter interactions, or a modeling headache, but rather they can be controlled,
enhanced and engineered in metamaterial platforms, offering new degrees of freedom for
enhanced wave control both in real and in reciprocal space. In this context, the emerging field
of nonlocal metasurfaces [575] has been flourishing, with remarkable demonstrations in three
relevant directions: i) spatial shaping of lattice resonances for enhanced metasurface control [576],
ii) analog-based image processing and optical computing at the nanoscale [577,578], and iii)
enhanced coherence control over light generation [526].
Beyond nonlocality, in a parallel research direction the dimension of time has recently offered
new opportunities to enhance the degrees of freedom available for wave control in metamaterials.
Beyond the three spatial dimensions, by engineering the arrow of time through tailored temporal
variations of the optical properties of engineered materials it is possible to realize advanced
functionalities and new wave phenomena, such as time interfaces, time scattering and time
crystals. In turn, suitable combinations of spatial and temporal structuring of a material have
been enabling space-time- or four-dimensional metamaterials with enhanced degrees of freedom
for wave control [579].
These seemingly disconnected research lines are likely to offer tremendous opportunities
when combined, with interesting prospects for fundamental research breakthroughs and for
applications across different scales. Indeed, nonlocalities broadly arise in natural and artificial
materials, both in space and time, and are particularly relevant in the context of resonant wave
phenomena, at the basis of metamaterials and metasurfaces. For instance, nonlocality engineering
in time has been considered in the context of temporal metamaterials [580], and space-time
nonlocality engineering in metasurfaces has been recently explored [581] to enable analog image
processing in space and time. By engineering the spatial and temporal dispersion of a passive
metasurface [Fig. 32(a)], it is possible to perform space-time differentiation of an incoming image
stream, enabling neuromorphic event detection through an ultrathin, passive metasurface [581].
This initial proposal leaves open several questions: to what extent is it possible to engineer
nonlocalities both in space and time, leading to superior control over spatial and frequency
dispersion in metamaterials? What range of applications can benefit from this control? What are
the fundamental limits in engineering space-time nonlocalities? What role do nonlocalities play
in the emerging field of space-time metamaterials?
Challenges and opportunities
A first step towards the experimental demonstration of space-time nonlocal metasurfaces was
recently shown in Ref. [582], in which passive metasurfaces performing the time-derivatives of
the incoming signal were demonstrated by tailoring their frequency dispersion. By cascading
two of such metasurfaces performing the first derivative of the incoming signal [Fig 32(b)], a
second-derivative device was also demonstrated, showing opportunities to realize more complex
operations by simply stacking multiple devices. While a metasurface showcasing engineered
nonlocalities in both space and time has not been demonstrated, this initial experiment has
highlighted a few challenges: the limited spatial extent over which a metasurface engages with
106


===== PAGE 107 =====
the wave in the propagation direction makes the control over nonlocalities inherently difficult.
In the devices demonstrated in Ref. [582], the event detection response is limited to temporal
variations in the picosecond range, which may be of interest for ultrafast imaging, but limits
other applications. For significantly slower temporal dynamics the demonstrated metasurfaces
operate at much reduced efficiency, and better responses can be obtained only at the price of
significantly increased resonance 𝑄factors, which is challenging for free-space operation and
limits the overall operational bandwidth. Another related challenge is reconfigurability: even
though these nonlocalities control both spatial and temporal dispersion, the underlying devices
are static in nature, which is appealing in terms of scalability and ease of implementation, but
it implies a non-reconfigurable response, which limits the application space. Moreover, the
demonstrated responses have so far been limited to linear operations, implying that the resulting
application is limited to Fourier-based operations. Extensions towards nonlinear space-time
operations may largely broaden the degree of applicability.

Engineered space-time nonlocality opens interesting opportunities not only in the field of
analog-based image processing, but also in other contexts. Metasurfaces with engineered
nonlocalities both in space and time can shape the coherence profile of their own thermal emission
and photoluminescence [526], converting oscillations of matter driven by incoherent processes
to efficient radiation with large temporal and spatial coherence, in the range of hundreds of
oscillation periods and free-space wavelengths. By combining these nonlocal phenomena with
local structuring in space of the underlying resonances, it is also possible to tailor the polarization
and wavefront profile at will [583], offering a new platform for compact, efficient and cheap
custom light generation. Yet, several challenges remain: taming incoherent processes is difficult,
making these metasurfaces sensitive to fabrication defects and disorder. The enhanced coherence
is fundamentally limited by these practical factors, as well as by the extent of the area over which
these devices can be reliably fabricated. Space-time nonlocality emerges as a very important
107


===== PAGE 108 =====
element in the accurate modeling of time and space-time metamaterials. Similar to how spatial
nonlocalities play an important role in capturing the response of metamaterials [584], temporal
nonlocalities cannot be neglected in the proper modeling of the wave scattering at temporal
interfaces [585, 586]. As a result, the microscopic implementations of time- and space-time
metamaterials, and the associated nonlocalities, are expected to play a crucial role in determining
the overall wave response, and their engineering may be leveraged to enhance its control.
Theoretical progress in the understanding of these interactions in space-time metamaterials, and
experimental progress on the implementation of space-time nonlocality engineering will be
fundamental to enable this vision.
Future developments to address challenges
The growing interest in engineered nonlocalities is driving impactful research that holds the
promise to address the challenges mentioned in the previous section, and leverage the many
available opportunities. The possibility of reconfiguring spatial nonlocalities has been recently
demonstrated in proof-of-concept metasurface devices relying on phase-change materials [587,
588], which may be extended to reconfigurable space-time nonlocality. Electro-optical or
all-optical modulation may extend the degrees of freedom that can be reconfigured, opening
dramatically the design and application. Space. Similarly, the limitation of resonance quality-
factors of free-space metasurfaces can be addressed with tailored designs and improved fabrication
techniques. Recent efforts have enabled demonstrations with quality-factors comparable to
integrated photonic platforms [589], opening many opportunities in the context of space-time
nonlocality engineering. Similar to diffractive nonlocal metasurfaces [576], which combine
local wavefront engineering in the spatial domain with nonlocality engineering in momentum
space, future developments may consider space-time local and nonlocal responses coming
together in the metasurface platform, offering opportunities to tailor dynamically space-time
dispersion of complex wavefronts, further expanding the degree of control over waves. Finally,
enhanced nonlinearities in metasurfaces, relying on strong light-matter interactions, as well as on
material engineering as in the case of multiple quantum wells [226], hold the promise to further
broaden the opportunities and impact of space-time nonlocalities by extending it to the control
of nonlinearly-generated signals through wave mixing, as well as to perform nonlinear image
processing in space and time.
Concluding remarks
The fields of nonlocal metasurfaces and of space-time metamaterials have been thriving in
recent years, and the initial attempts of merging these research areas have been showcasing
tremendous opportunities for the future of metamaterials and metasurfaces, providing enhanced
wavefront control, signal processing and neuromorphic computing, and coherence control in
space and time over thermally generated light or photoluminescence. Once mature, space-time
nonlocality engineering holds the promise to be another exciting toolbox for photonic engineers
and metamaterial scientists.

Spectral and angular control of light with nonlocal metasurfaces
JUNG-HWAN SONG
AND MARK L. BRONGERSMA
Overview
Many emerging imaging, sensing, communication, display, and non-linear optics applications
require compact optical elements that can selectively manipulate light waves at very well-
defined wavelengths and/or angles of incidence. In this Roadmap article we argue that nonlocal
metasurfaces are ideally suited for this purpose. We further highlight that a careful spectral
108


===== PAGE 109 =====
engineering of the optical materials loss in such optical elements opens a unique opportunity to
fully-decouple the optical functions at different illumination wavelengths.
Current status
The field of metasurface flat-optics has opened a myriad of new ways to control the flow of light
beyond the capabilities of polished pieces of glass and geometrically-shaped metallic mirrors.
Metasurface optical elements can be created by judiciously nanostructuring thin films of metal
or semiconductor materials. They effectively harness light scattering and optical interference
processes to achieve a very wide range of valuable optical functions [590,591]. Low-cost and
large-area nanofabrication techniques as well as advanced computational tools are now propelling
these optical elements into real, commercial applications [592] and highly-integrated device
technologies [593,594]. Metasurfaces can broadly be divided into two distinct classes based
on their operational principle. There are local metasurfaces for which the optical interaction
between neighboring nanostructures or "meta-atoms" is weak and nonlocal metasurfaces in
which the coupling is substantial and can extend over a long range. Recent work provides helpful
insights into the ways that the meta-atom geometry can be engineered to transition between
local and nonlocal behaviors [595]. Each type has their unique application spaces, advantages,
and limitations. The design of local metasurfaces is conceptually very simple as one can think
of each nanostructure imparting independent, local, spatially-varying amplitude, phase, and
polarization changes on an optical wavefront. These optical manipulations can be controlled
through judicious choices of the nanostructure sizes, shapes, orientations and spatial arrangements.
A growing intuition about the operation of local metasurfaces together with powerful rapid-design
software tools based on topological optimization, inverse design and deep-learning principles has
facilitated rapid progress in their development [596–598]. At the same time, it is worth pointing
out that there is always some degree of optical coupling between meta-atoms present and this can
result in notable performance limitations in terms of the achievable diffraction efficiency [599]. In
contrast, nonlocal metasurfaces strategically take advantage of the optical coupling and collective
responses of nanostructures to boost efficiency. Based on their distinct nature, local and nonlocal
metasurfaces display notably different spectral and angular responses. For local metasurfaces
these properties are intimately connected to those of the meta-atom building blocks they are
constructed from. They can be either non-resonant, truncated waveguides [600] or employ
optically-resonant plasmonic [601,602] or Mie [603] resonators with low optical quality factor
(𝑄) resonances. As a result, the nanostructures deliver display light scattering responses that
are broad in terms of their spectral and angular characteristics. As the nanostructures in a local
metasurface more-or-less act independently, these traits are naturally transferred to the entire
optical element. This is advantageous when the goal is to realize optical elements that can operate
across a broad spectral range and need to deliver a high numerical aperture. However, this is
detrimental in applications that require the selective manipulation of light waves at well-defined
frequencies and/or angles incidence. This is an area where nonlocal metasurfaces can shine.
Challenges and opportunities
Many modern day optics applications require extreme control over the spectral and angular
properties of light. For example, in imaging and microscopy spectral control helps to mitigate aber-
rations and produce sharper images. Spectroscopy and sensing tools require spectrally-selective
optical excitation and analysis of light to analyze materials properties, chemical composition,
and molecular structure. In optical communication systems, spectral and angular control enables
the precise management of light signals for efficient data transmission, multiplexing, and de-
multiplexing. Local metasurfaces have displayed challenges in delivering the required spectral
and angular control, but nonlocal metasurfaces can capitalize on the optical interaction between
the building blocks to achieve such functions in an integrated form factor. To understand why
109


===== PAGE 110 =====
nonlocal metasurfaces can provide superior control over the angular and spectral properties of
light, we investigate how they are designed and operate at a conceptual level. In the design of
most local metasurface structures, one arranges the meta-atoms to achieve a transmission function
𝑡(𝑥, 𝑦) that is dependent locally on the spatial coordinates 𝑥and 𝑦. For example, in a metalens
the transmission function is designed to achieve a local space-variant phase shift that shapes the
wavefront in the same fashion as a polished lens [604]. In contrast, a nonlocal metasurface is
designed to deliver a transmission function 𝑡(𝑘𝑥, 𝑘𝑦) that is dependent on the wave-vectors 𝑘𝑥
and 𝑘𝑦of the incident light [575,605] (see also Section 27 of this Roadmap). In other words,
this type of metasurface will differently manipulate light waves with distinct incident angles.
Fig. 33 illustrates in a tutorial example how the spectral- and angle-dependent behaviors can be
engineered. Figure 33(a) shows a very basic nonlocal metasurface comprised of a 240 nm thick
single-mode silicon nitride (Si3N4) slab waveguide with a surface-relief grating etched into its
top surface [606]. Light incident on this optical element can follow two distinct pathways. Most
commonly, the incident light waves follow a direct transmission pathway through the patterned
nitride layer. The spectral transmission behavior for this pathway mimics the transmission for a
regular, low quality-factor (𝑄∼2) Fabry–Pérot resonator and only a gentle buildup of field can be
seen in the optical simulation. However, at selected wavelength and incident-angle combinations,
the grating can resonantly couple free-space light waves to quasi-guided modes. Such coupling is
facilitated by the power of constructive interference, where all of the small grating teeth can work
in concert to scatter and effectively redirect the incident light waves into the nitride waveguide.
For the discussion that follows, it is important to note that this can lead to a notable energy
storage in the waveguide and a very substantial increase in the electric field in the waveguide.
This field build up can be seen in the optical simulation for the second pathway. In the same way
the grating can couple the light into the waveguide, it also causes the guided light to slowly leak
back out of the structure. In the forward direction the leaked waves interfere with the directly
transmitted light. On the grating coupling resonance, this interference is destructive and gives
rise to a pronounced dip in the spectral transmission spectra [Fig. 33(b)]. The amplitude of the
grating elements determines the coupling efficiency in/out of the waveguide and thus also the
radiative quality factor (𝑄𝑟) for the resonances. The period controls the wavelength at which the
light is coupled. In this example, a grating period of 390 nm places the resonance at 630 nm
for normally-incident light with a transverse magnetic (TM) polarization (the magnetic-field is
pointing along the grooves of the grating). The grating depth was chosen to be 90 nm to produce
a resonance with a quality factor 𝑄= 60.
Figure 33(c) shows the simulated angle-dependent transmittance on resonance (𝜆0 = 630 nm)
and for illumination wavelengths 3 nm above and below it. It highlights that the sharp transmission
feature also naturally comes with a narrow angular selectivity. The dispersion relation of the
nitride waveguide mode governs for what pairs of wavelengths and angles light coupling can be
achieved. For analog optical computing, image processing, and the compression of free-space
in optical systems, it is critical to have nonlocal metasurfaces with well-defined dispersive
behaviors that can be engineered through their geometric parameters. In other applications, it
can be desirable to fully decouple the optical functions at different wavelengths and angles of
incidence. Eye tracking is an illustrative application and we discuss it below. Figure 34(a) shows
a photograph of a basic eye tracker prototype where we patterned a large-area high-𝑄, nonlocal
metasurface on a pair of glasses [18]. A near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diode emitting at
870 nm illuminates the eye and the metasurface redirects the scattered light from the eye toward
a miniature camera that is attached to one of the arms. The metasurface should provide the
person wearing the glasses with an unperturbed view of the outside world, while a high-speed
camera can image and follow the eye’s motion. This can in principle be accomplished with other
compact optical elements (e.g. gratings, miniature prisms, local metasurfaces, and waveguides)
placed directly in front of the eye, but these dispersive components inevitably produce unwanted

rainbows [Fig. 34(b)]. This is very distracting when used in environments with bright optical
sources, such as the sun. A high-𝑄, nonlocal metasurface can provide a solution to this problem
by performing different, independent operations on light waves at different frequencies and
incident angles. In our example, all light waves in the visible (VIS) spectrum should be allowed
to pass completely unperturbed, independent of the incident angle. However, in the NIR we aim
to only redirect light across a narrow band of wavelengths and a small range of angles to the
camera for imaging.

===== PAGE 112 =====
To see the benefits of our metasurface design, we first consider the properties of a conventional
grating comprised of 30 nm thick chromium (Cr) strips whose dimensions were optimized to
redirect 10% of a normally-incident NIR beam through the first diffracted order. Figure 34(b)
shows the low transmission of this element and the intense rainbows that it creates. These
aspects are shown quantitatively as the black curves in Figure 34(d,e). The rainbow is formed
because of the high efficiency for light redirection into the first diffracted order. Figure 34(c)
shows the same scene as viewed through a high-𝑄, nonlocal metasurface that has 3 nm thick
poly-crystalline silicon (pSi) strips placed on a Si3N4 waveguide. This nonlocal metasurface
shows a very high transmissivity at normal incidence across the visible range (89% on average).
This can be expected as the grating is at least 2 orders of magnitude thinner than the absorption
depth in pSi. Moreover, with proper design the Si3N4 waveguide and silica cover can also serve
as a high-performance, double-layer antireflection coating. The transmission spectrum for the
nonlocal metasurface shows a sharp spectral feature near 870 nm that can be attributed to the
excitation of the guided resonance. At this resonance, a second indirect pathway for the light
through the structure. On resonance, about 40% of the light is taken out of the incident beam and
redirected into four first-order diffracted beams (+1 and −1 in forward and backward directions).
Based on the high diffraction efficiency seen at 870 nm, one would naturally expect to see high
diffraction-efficiencies in the visible range as well. However, the guide mode resonances in
the VIS (at 608 nm, 496 nm, and 470 nm) display a very low diffraction-efficiency (< 0.07%),
explaining the virtual absence of rainbows as shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 34(e). The
difference in behavior in the VIS and NIR lies in the spectral absorption properties of the
3-nm-thin pSi metasurface elements. The significant suppression of diffractions in the VIS takes
place when the absorption coefficient of pSi is above 1 cm−1 [purple shaded region in Fig. 34(e)].
This can be seen by analyzing the dashed curves in Fig. 34(d,e) that show the transmission
and diffraction efficiency for the case that the materials absorption in pSi is artificially set to
zero. They highlight how the materials absorption in the metasurface elements can control the
flow of light through the device on resonance; In the presence/absence of materials absorption,
the diffracted orders can selectively be turned off/on without notably impacting the response
off-resonance. One key insight is that all of the light that is redirected by the nonlocal metasurface
has to flow through the waveguide first (i.e. follows the resonant channel). Because of the high 𝑄
of the resonance, the light-matter interaction in the waveguide is very strong. As such, even very
small amounts of materials absorption in the waveguide can dramatically impact the flow of light
through the structure. When the absorption efficiency of the metasurface elements (pSi strips)
exceeds their scattering efficiency, the guided mode is damped and all of the light will necessarily
follow the direct path only. As pSi strongly absorbs light in the visible, the diffraction channels
and rainbows are effectively suppressed. When the absorption is weak (for pSi in the infrared),
the light will couple to the guided mode and be decoupled from the waveguide to the camera
before it is absorbed. At a high level, this example shows that diffractive optical functions can be
deactivated by introducing a little bit of materials absorption.
Future developments and concluding remarks
The use of materials absorption in nonlocal metasurfaces brings the valuable opportunity to
decouple optical functions at different wavelengths and angles. In the eye tracking example,
this was utilized to achieve different behaviors in the visible (transparency) and infrared regime
(imaging of the eye). By further engineering the spectral absorption behaviors, one can imagine
achieving highly-selective transmission/reflection of light waves at certain frequencies and/or
incident angles. Through the introduction of materials with dynamically tunable absorption
features, it may also be possible to modulate such transmission speeds that are ultimately only
limited by the quality factor of the nonlocal metasurface. Such optical elements will have a range
of applications in optical imaging, computation, communication, and sensing.

Nonlocal metalenses
URIEL LEVY
Overview
Metasurfaces are artificially engineered, subwavelength-thickness and subwavelength patterned
optical surfaces that can control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. They can also
enhance light-matter interactions at the nanoscale [590,604,608–612]. Such metasurfaces can
be classified into local or nonlocal metasurfaces, depending on the interaction of light with
the nanoscale meta-atoms of the metasurface. If the metasurface is based on the interaction
of light with an individual meta-atom and long-range interactions does not play a role, the
metasurface is coined "local metasurface". If on the other hand, the effect depends not only on
the local phase control arising from the independent response of each meta-atom but also on the
nonlocal (collective) resonance excitation originating from the interactions between neighboring
meta-atoms, the metasurface is coined "nonlocal metasurface". The latter offers opportunities
related to high 𝑄resonance [589,613], wavelength selectivity and tunability [614–617]. One of
the most dominant types of metasurfaces is the metalens, sometimes defined also as a metasurface
lens. The metalens is a flat optical device that performs similar operations as conventional
lenses. However, its phase is controlled by the interaction of light with the meta-atom, and
the diffraction angle is also dictated by the local periodicity of the metalens, which is typically
chirped away of its center, to facilities larger diffraction angles that are needed to focus all incident
parallel light rays to the same focal spot [618,619]. In essence, the metalens is an advanced
version of the diffractive lens, and it offers several advantages over diffractive lens, the such as
polarization control, continuous phase control using a binary structure, CMOS compatibility,
and reduced thickness to name a few [620]. Being based on diffraction, metalenses are inherently
dispersive, featuring strong chromatic aberrations [621]. This is perhaps one of the main, if not
the major drawback of metalenses, limiting their applicability to narrow band use cases. However,
for broadband illumination, it would be ideal if the metalens can support large bandwidth, or
alternatively provide high transmission only at the wavelength which it is designed for, while not
affecting other wavelengths to avoid blurred image. To do so, the metalens needs to be highly
spectral selective, which is typically achieved using a high 𝑄resonance mechanism. This is
where nonlocal metalenses come into play.
Current status
In recent years, several nonlocal metalenses have been demonstrated.
Malek et al. [622]
demonstrated a nonlocal metalenses based on nonlocal dielectric metasurfaces that offer both
spatial and spectral control of light. The demonstrated metalens was focusing light exclusively
over a narrowband resonance while leaving off-resonant frequencies unaffected. Meta-atoms
were designed based on the concept of quasi bound state in the continuum (q-BIC), encoded
with a spatially varying geometric phase. They achieved effective transmission (polarization
conversion efficiency) of 8%, lower than the theoretical limit of 25%, and a 𝑄factor of 86. It is
mentioned that conversion efficiency can be further increased by better design, better fabrication
and higher out of plane symmetry breaking. Yao et al. [623] also demonstrated a nonlocal
high-𝑄Huygens’ metalens operating under circular polarized illumination and explored its
application in wavelength-selective imaging. To do so, an integrated-resonant unit (IRU) was
designed to achieve a balance between 𝑄-factor, efficiency, and the robustness of meta-atom’s
orientation. By introducing structural asymmetry in the configuration, they could excite the leaky
q-BIC mode, resulting in a high 𝑄-factor. Each IRU consisted of a crescent nanopillar made
of amorphous silicon placed on the silica substrate. Three different designs were fabricated,
with 𝑄factor as high as ∼100 and very high polarization conversion efficiency of ∼70%. The
113


===== PAGE 114 =====
high efficiency, effectively exceeding the theoretical limit of 25%, is attributed to varying
the structural parameters to modulate the resonant wavelengths of magnetic dipole resonance
and the q-BIC mode. Basically, subwavelength-thick local metalenses perform well only over
a limited input angular range, whereas nonlocal metalenses can achieve high efficiency and
diffraction-limited characteristics over a much wider field of view (FOV). Yet, such nonlocal
metalenses are typically thicker, as they need a minimal thickness to provide the nonlocality.
Since a large FOV requires an angle-dependent response (i.e., angular dispersion), a spatially
localized incident wave must spread as it propagates through the metalens under space-angle
Fourier transform. Thus, increasing the angular diversity can be facilitated by increasing the
degree of nonlocality. Based on this, Li and Hsu [624] discussed the thickness bound for nonlocal
wide field of view (FOV) metalenses. They were able to show that there is an intrinsic trade-off
between achieving a desired broad-angle response and reducing the thickness of the metalens.
This thickness bound originates from the Fourier transform duality between space and angle.
When applied to wide-FOV lenses, their approach predicted the minimal thickness as a function
of the FOV, metalens diameter, and numerical aperture. Their formalism can provide guidance
for the design of nonlocal metasurfaces in general, and nonlocal metalenses in particular, with
the understanding that mitigating high FOV by a metalens of negligible thickness might be an
extremely challenging task. In another paper [625], the same authors introduced transmission
efficiency limit for nonlocal metalenses. Using the same concept of describing the device as a
transmission matrix that relates the input to the output, they were able to develop a term that links
the efficiency to various metalens parameters. Specifically, it was shown that if the input and the
output apertures are equal, the efficiency drops with the increase of the numerical aperture (NA)
following the relation 𝜂∝
√︁
1 −NA2, where 𝜂is the efficiency. However, if the input aperture
is set to an optimal value, an increased transmission efficiency bound is obtained significantly
surpassing this relation.
Challenges and opportunities
One of the major opportunities of nonlocal metalenses is the ability to control the amplitude,
phase and polarization response as a function of angle (see also Section 26 of this Roadmap).
This may provide an opportunity to address the challenge of reducing aberration in large FOV
applications, typically encountered in modern imaging. For example, the main camera of a
smartphone can now support FOV as high as ∼800, and the ultra-wide camera supports an even
higher FOV. This imposes a great challenge in the design process of the metalens. Clearly, a
slightly thickener metalens which is designed to take advantage of the nonlocal phase response
may cope better with the goal of supporting a higher FOV. Here, focusing on narrow band
illumination may become helpful, because supporting simultaneously large bandwidth, large FOV
and large Fresnel number (for high light collection efficiency) is perhaps beyond the capability of
a wavelength or subwavelength-thick metalens. Another challenge of the nonlocal metalens is
related to nanofabrication. While simulations show that high 𝑄nonlocal metalenses are feasible,
it is extremely difficult to achieve such high 𝑄values in practice. Any small deviation from the
design parameters due to fabrication imperfection may result in a significant decrease in the
𝑄factor. This is particularly relevant for nonlocal metalens, relying on a collective response
of the meta-atoms. In such a case, a small perturbation in one or a few meta-atoms will affect
the response of the entire device. Considering the need for large apertures to support high light
collection efficiency and high 𝑄factor in collective modes, the material from which metalens
is made is crucial. While for the near infrared (beyond ∼1 micron wavelength) amorphous
silicon is an excellent material choice, this is not the case for shorter wavelength, where the
absorption of amorphous silicon is a limiting factor. Materials such as titanium dioxide are not
CMOS compatible and are very difficult to handle over a large area. A promising direction for
the implementation of nonlocal metasurfaces and particularly nonlocal metalenses operating
114


===== PAGE 115 =====
in the visible range is to use silicon rich nitride (SRN). SRN films can be easily applied on
almost any substrate using a relatively simple process, e.g. using plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition (PECVD). The refractive index of the SRN film can be tuned by controlling the
atomic ratio between silicon and nitride. We have recently implemented metasurfaces based on
SRN for digital holography and structural colors applications, and a similar material platform
can be applied for nonlocal metalenses [626, 627]. As mentioned before, one of the major
opportunities of nonlocal metalenses is the capability to achieve high 𝑄factor. On the one hand,
this requires a delicate design that combines the local phase response with the collective response
of many meta atoms. On the other hand, as discussed before, the interference between local
modes and nonlocal modes is helpful in overcoming transmission limitations. The high 𝑄factor
implies that the design is sensitive to fabrication imperfection and environmental effects such
as temperature drifts. Yet, it allows large tunability using e.g. the Pockels or the Kerr effect,
the plasma dispersion effect in semiconductors, the thermo optic effect. Tunability can also be
achieved by structural modifications (e.g. MEMS based device [628,629], and the use of external
medium such as liquid [630] and even quantum vapor [631]. Real time tunability of nonlocal
metalenses is probably one of the major research topics in the field.
Future developments to address challenges
The previous sections have been dealing with the status of nonlocal metalenses and highlighted
opportunities related to nonlocality. Yet, a single nonlocal metalens, while holding a great
promise, will probably be unable to cope with the grand challenge of simultaneously providing
diffraction limited imaging with ultra-high resolution over the entire visible range, with large
Fresnel number and large FOV. One possible way to overcome this limitation is to consider
a hybrid refractive-metasurface design, where most of the optical power will be delivered by
the refractive optical system, whereas the metasurface/metalens will be used for improving the
imaging quality by providing some sort of aberration correction. The metasurface/metalens can
also be used to simplify the requirements from the refractive optical system. Another possible
avenue is to use a multi-layer nonlocal metalens, providing additional degrees of freedom and
a slightly larger thickness to improve the quality of the metalens. In our opinion, an even
more promising direction is to use the hybrid concept of combining the nonlocal metalens
with computational imaging approach. This has been recently demonstrated for a local flat
lens [632]. As shown in Fig. 35, the flat lens produced a highly chromatic aberrated image. Yet,
by applying a deep-learning-based approach, and a proper training procedure it was possible to
overcome chromatic aberrations of flat lens-based imaging systems operating outdoors under
normal ambient illumination conditions. This approach, combined with advanced nonlocal
metalens design, may be used to achieve high quality imaging under different scenarios, ranging
from ambient light conditions to multi-color LED illumination.
Concluding remarks
The use of nonlocal metalenses in imaging systems may provide an enhanced tool for the
realization of high quality imaging systems based on flat optics technology. The capability
to control amplitude, phase and polarization as a function of incident angle and wavelength
of illumination may pave the way for advanced imaging functionalities. Nonlocal metalenses
may also provide multi-functionality, such as imaging and spectral filtering, imaging and FOV
manipulations, and polarimetric imaging to name a few. While this chapter was focused on the
visible and the near infrared spectral regime, nonlocal metalenses can also be used for imaging
applications at longer wavelengths, ranging from the mid infrared, through the thermal domain,
and all the way to the terahertz. Finally, it is important to understand that while a single nonlocal
metalens can be very useful for many use cases, it cannot cope with the grand challenge of
performing diffraction limited imaging over large bandwidth, large FOV and high Fresnel number

simultaneously. For such a task, applying hybrid approaches e.g. refractive lens and nonlocal
metalens, or nonlocal metalens with additional computation imaging effort is a key for mitigating
the stringent requirements of modern imaging systems.

Nonlocal metasurfaces for space compression
OLIVIA Y. LONG
, CHENG GUO
& SHANHUI FAN
Current status
Miniaturization has been a common trend in the development of optical technologies, driven
by the goal of improved efficiency, compactness, and portability of devices. With the rapid
rise of artificial intelligence, there is an accompanying need for fast processing of large data
inputs in a scalable way, further fueling the endeavor for smaller components [633]. The bulk of
conventional optical setups consists of free-space, including space filled with uniform dielectric
materials [634]. In recent decades, metasurfaces with subwavelength scatterers have attracted
increasing attention for their ability to manipulate the phase, amplitude, and polarization of
light, paralleling advances in nanofabrication techniques [635]. However, most research efforts
have been toward designing more compact optical components such as lenses, bandpass filters,
quarter-wave plates, and polarization converters [636]. Here, we focus on a complementary
effort: the compression of free-space.
The propagation of light in free space over a distance 𝑑in the paraxial regime is described by
a quadratic phase transfer function [634]:
𝐻(𝑘∥) = 𝑒−𝑖𝑘0𝑑𝑒𝑖𝜆0𝑑
4𝜋𝑘2
∥
(66)
where 𝑘0, 𝜆0, and 𝑘∥are the free-space wavevector, free-space wavelength, and transverse
component of the wavevector, respectively. To compress free space, one aims to construct a
device that achieves the same phase transfer function of Eq. (66), but with a physical thickness
that is much smaller than the distance 𝑑. To achieve this aim, the dependence on the transverse
wavevector component 𝑘∥naturally suggests the use of nonlocal metasurfaces, which manipulate
116


===== PAGE 117 =====
light in the wavevector space. To effectively compress space, the designed metasurface, with
a thickness 𝑑𝑚, should impart a phase factor 𝑒𝑖𝜙𝑘2
∥, with the equivalent free-space propagation
distance 𝑑= 4𝜋𝜙/𝜆0 > 𝑑𝑚. The performance of the metasurface can thus be quantified by a
compression ratio 𝑅= 𝑑/𝑑𝑚. Moreover, the amplitude of each 𝑘∥-component of the incident
light should ideally be preserved over a wide frequency bandwidth and range of incident angles.
Fig. 36(a) schematically shows the free-space propagation distance 𝑑(top inset) that is replaced by
transmission through a nonlocal metasurface (bottom inset). The compression ratio is determined
by the quadratic dependence of the transmission phase on 𝑘∥. A comparison of three ideal
transmission phase profiles with different compression ratios is shown in Fig. 36(b), and the
ideal transmission amplitude as a function of 𝑘∥is depicted in Fig. 36(c), where the magnitude
remains unity for all angles of incidence.

Pioneering theoretical proposals for space compression harnessed guided mode resonances
of photonic crystal slabs [637] and multilayer structures [638], while the first experimental
demonstrations employed a uniaxial crystal and low-index homogeneous media [638] to achieve
the desired transfer function [Eq. (66)]. To date, other nonlocal metasurface designs for space
compression (also referred to as "spaceplates") include Fabry–Pérot resonators [639,640], 4 𝑓
lens-based approaches [641], and Huygens’ metasurfaces [642], as well as photonic crystal
and multilayer designs with additional functionalities and optimizations [643–645]. A visual
summary of many of these design approaches is provided in Fig. 37.
Single guided-mode resonance designs have achieved compression ratios ranging from 5
to 144 with numerical apertures (NA) of 0.32 and 0.01, respectively, often with polarization

dependencies and limited bandwidths of operation [637,639,643]. Multiple coupled resonances
have been shown to yield wider operating bandwidths [639], and optimized multilayers have
achieved larger compression ratios of 340 at the expense of a relatively small NA (0.017) [645].
Thus, specific platforms may be more favorable depending on the specific use case. Ongoing
research strives to achieve the ideal structure with simultaneously high compression ratio, large
NA, wide frequency bandwidth, and polarization independence. In this article, we focus on the
approach of nonlocal metasurfaces for space compression.
Challenges and opportunities
In general designs for space compression, one would like to have strong quadratic dependence of
the phase 𝜙(𝑘∥) on the transverse wavevector 𝑘∥to achieve higher space compression ratios. In
the nonlocal metasurface approach, one uses resonances to achieve such quadratic dependence.
However, since the strongest dependencies on 𝑘∥occur near resonances, such designs are
limited by a narrow frequency bandwidth of operation. Thus, one challenge in this approach to
space compression is the inherent tradeoff between the frequency bandwidth and the transverse
wavevector range of operation (numerical aperture). Proposed approaches to achieve wider
bandwidths to date include using multiple resonances [639].
Polarization-independent operation would also be advantageous for integration into existing
optical systems. One drawback of many recent designs, including both designs using nonlocal
118


===== PAGE 119 =====
metasurfaces and designs based on multilayer films, is that the optical response of the device
differs for TM and TE polarized light. Recent work has proposed polarization-independent space
compression using a photonic crystal slab structure that features bands with similar curvatures,
resulting in similar resonance responses for each polarization [643]. It is of interest to achieve
polarization independence as well as a large compression ratio over a sufficiently large numerical
aperture.
Since nonlocal metasurfaces for space compression have been mostly applied to imaging
applications thus far and are often used in conjunction with lenses, it is desirable to achieve
designs with tunable compression ratios for the purpose of reconfigurable focal distances. Thus,
another opportunity for future development is in improving the programmability of such nonlocal
nanophotonic structures. Efforts in the area of active nonlocal metasurfaces have included
electro-optic, mechanical, and thermo-optic tuning [646].
Challenges in such approaches
include operation efficiencies, speed of reconfigurability, and maintaining a pure phase response
throughout the tuning process.
There is ample opportunity to explore integration of space compression with other function-
alities, with the goal of expanding the domain of applications beyond conventional imaging.
For example, the narrow bandwidth and angular ranges of current designs could be harnessed
to achieve simultaneous polarization conversion or diffraction suppression at other operating
wavelengths, which can be useful in augmented reality and eye-tracking technologies [607,647].
Nonlocal spaceplates can also be co-designed with existing lenses and local metasurfaces for
functionalities such as aberration correction, as demonstrated in Ref. [644].
Finally, in the design of nonlocal metasurface for space compression, a theoretical challenge is
to understand the tradeoff between various performance metrics, such as frequency bandwidth,
numerical aperture, polarization independence, and compression ratio. For multilayer and
single-resonance structures, the tradeoffs between frequency bandwidth and numerical aperture,
and between frequency bandwidth and compression ratio, have been examined in Ref. [648].
There have also been works on the fundamental constraints of the thickness of optical devices in
general [649]. It would be of interest to apply and further develop the formalisms in these papers
to understand the design tradeoff in nonlocal metasurfaces.
Future developments to address challenges
One of the challenges in achieving widespread adoption is designing nonlocal metasurfaces
with the target performance metrics such as numerical aperture, bandwidth, and efficiency.
Thus, future development in the understanding of the spaceplate design space would help
accelerate the integration of such devices in optical systems. Exploration of the design space of
space-compressing nonlocal structures has thus far included gradient-based optimization [644]
and exploiting topological properties in the structural parameter space [650]. With the rise
of artificial intelligence, we anticipate further optimization of existing designs using machine
learning techniques such as those based on neural networks.
The development of new techniques for fast programmability of the compression ratio
would help increase the range of applications for space-compressing nonlocal metasurfaces.
Technological advances in areas such as electrically and optically tunable materials would
contribute to greater reconfigurability in both nonlocal and local metasurface designs [651]. The
simulation of metasurfaces designed with such materials would also be an interesting theoretical
opportunity to explore.
Given that nonlocal metasurfaces are a more recent development compared to local metasurfaces,
future integration of the two could help address the challenge of increasing multifunctionality.
By harnessing the momentum-space control of nonlocal metasurfaces and the local wavefront
control of local metasurfaces, new emergent functionalities will enable next-generation optical
systems. For instance, a recent work demonstrates the use of spaceplates in correcting both
119


===== PAGE 120 =====
chromatic and spherical aberrations from refractive and local metasurface lenses [644]. Building
upon this work, the development of adaptive, tunable devices for automatic aberration correction
represents an exciting frontier. Such multifunctional capabilities further expand the potential
applications of nonlocal metasurfaces. Furthermore, the co-design of nonlocal metasurfaces with
a computational backend may help overcome some of the limitations of the metasurface alone, as
demonstrated recently for local metasurfaces [652].
Beyond single-resonance-based designs, multiple coupled resonances offer promising opportu-
nities for improved performance. The key challenge lies in optimizing the collective arrangement
of resonance poles to achieve both unity transmission amplitude and the desired phase response
across a broader bandwidth. This complex optimization problem is particularly well-suited for
machine learning and AI methods, which can efficiently explore the vast design space.
While our discussion has focused on compression of free space, similar principles could be
extended to guided waves. An intriguing question emerges: can we compress the propagation
length in waveguide arrays or in multimode waveguides? This concept could significantly reduce
the footprint of photonic links in integrated photonic circuits, opening new possibilities for
compact optical interconnects.
Looking beyond electromagnetic waves, these space compression principles could be extended
to other wave varieties, including electron, spin, and acoustic waves. Particularly promising is the
application to electron optics, where compressed free-space propagation could enhance electron
microscopy capabilities. Similarly, the manipulation of spin and acoustic waves through space
compression could enable novel functionalities in materials science and device engineering.
Concluding remarks
With further advancements in key metrics such as numerical aperture, bandwidth, and compression
ratios, the integration of nonlocal metasurfaces for space compression into everyday optical
devices such as cameras could become a reality in the near future. Moreover, the functionality
of nonlocal space compression, in combination with those of local metasurfaces, highlights the
rapidly advancing techniques in the precise manipulation of light at an increasingly smaller scale.
The demonstration of space compression points to the potential for many more possibilities in
the area of nonlocal metasurfaces, which may expand beyond imaging.

Electro-optic spatiotemporal nonlocal metasurfaces
SERGEY I. BOZHEVOLNYI
Overview
Spatiotemporal light control with dynamic optical metasurfaces has been high on the research
agenda, promising attractive solutions and new avenues for modern highly integrated optics
and nanophotonics. Due to ultrafast responses of electro-optic materials, various electro-optic
metasurface configurations have been scrutinized with the aim of realizing both efficient and
ultrafast dynamic metasurfaces. Given fundamentally nm-thin metasurfaces and very weak electro-
optic responses, advances towards this ambitious goal have been facing enormous challenges
without any clear way through at hand. Here, several promising electro-optic metasurface
configurations are presented that exploit nonlocal interactions between incident radiation and
grating-excited waveguide modes propagating inside nm-thin electro-optic films. Challenges
and opportunities for spatiotemporal light control with electro-optic nonlocal metasurfaces are
discussed, outlining also future developments towards tackling the most serious challenges and
exploiting the most exciting opportunities.
120


===== PAGE 121 =====
Current status
Optical metasurfaces formed by surface arrays of nanoscale resonant elements constitute one of
the most vibrant and explosively developing fields in modern optics and photonics, primarily
due to their ability to effectuate complete control over the transmitted/reflected fields enabling
thereby diverse optical functionalities, including those not realizable with conventional bulky
optics [653]. Most metasurfaces are however static in nature with their optical responses being
determined at the design stage and set in the process of fabrication. Recent years have therefore
seen increasing efforts to realize dynamically controlled (tunable) optical metasurfaces, rapidly
progressing towards faster operation and realization of spatiotemporal light control, which is
immensely attractive for many fascinating phenomena waiting to be realized and exploited
in highly integrated optics and nanophotonics [654]. Among various types of dynamically
controlled metasurfaces, electrically tunable optical metasurfaces have shown great promise due
to their fast response time, low power consumption, and compatibility with existing electronic
control systems, offering unique possibilities for dynamic tunability of light–matter interactions
via electrical modulation. It should be noted that to exercise truly spatiotemporal light control,
the electrical operation bandwidth should exceed, preferably by orders of magnitude, the optical
bandwidth of the radiation to be controlled, requiring thereby ultrafast modulation [654]. The
linear electro-optic (Pockels) effect, which is found in several crystalline (ordered) media without
center of symmetry, ensures inherently fast electrical control of material birefringence with femto-
or even attosecond-short response times. The main challenge when utilizing the electro-optic
materials in optical metasurfaces is associated with inherently small refractive index variations
accessible, a circumstance that, in combination with fundamentally thin nature of metasurfaces,
results in enormous difficulties in their practical realization.
Electro-optic metasurface configurations, whether based on electro-optic polymers [655] or
lithium niobate (LN) films [615,656], are designed to have electro-optic thin films sandwiched
between bottom and top electrodes that can modify the film refractive index and thereby control
the metasurface response [615,655,656]. Since the film thickness is typically subwavelength and
the electro-optically induced index changes are very small (< 10−3), one should exploit resonant
configurations that would increase the effective interaction length either by multiple reflections
across the metasurface layer (i.e., electro-optic thin film) in Fabry–Pérot resonators [656] or by
the nonlocal interaction [127] of incident radiation with waveguide modes propagating along the
metasurface layer [615,655]. The latter approach is somewhat alike to that based on the nonlocal
interaction with surface lattice resonance (SLR) modes, typically enhanced by simultaneous
excitation of localized nanoparticle Mie [655] or plasmon [656] resonances. The excitation of
quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) has also been exploited [655]. Considering the
experimental characteristics demonstrated for these configurations [615,655,656], while those
based on electro-optic polymers exhibited superior efficiency and bandwidth [655], LN-based
electro-optic metasurfaces [615,656] offer potentially similar bandwidth along with the excellent
environmental (temperature) stability, a feature that is in a stark contrast with electro-optic
polymers exhibiting typically a glass temperature below 100◦C.
Challenges and opportunities
The prior research into electro-optic metasurfaces has convincingly demonstrated that the
best performance is expected from the configurations involving the nonlocal interaction of
incident radiation with waveguide modes propagating along the electro-optic layer. The design
optimization goal is then to identify the physical mechanism along with the modes involved that
would result in ultra-narrow transmission/reflection minima/maxima, since those would most
efficiently be influenced even with very weak, electro-optically induced, refractive index changes.
The guided mode excitation by gratings is governed by phase-matching that can result in very
narrow transmission/reflection spectral features, often referred to as guided-mode resonances
121


===== PAGE 122 =====
(GMRs), for very wide gratings and nearly parallel incident light [657]. The latter requirement is
not compatible with designing compact and robust practical devices and components. One can
circumvent this challenge by making the excited waveguide modes to bounce back and forth in a
distributed Bragg resonator (DBR), thus effectively extending the interaction between guided
modes and grating couplers. Fortunately, this possibility seems being naturally present for the
waveguide mode excitation by normal light incidence [658].
Fig. 38. Schematic of an LN-based electro-optic metasurface operating under normal
light incidence that, under the phase-matching condition, results in the excitation
of counter-propagating waveguide modes. These modes, upon interaction with the
electrode grating structure, couple out of the waveguide and Bragg reflect into each
other.
Let us consider a generic LN-based configuration of electro-optic metasurfaces illuminated at
normal light incidence (Fig. 38). The first-order phase matching between the incident light and
counter-propagating waveguide modes requires that the grating period, Λ, matches the waveguide
mode wavelength, 𝜆𝑊= 𝜆/𝑁eff, where 𝑁eff is the effective mode index and 𝜆is the wavelength
in vacuum. Once this condition is satisfied, the waveguide modes experience the Bragg reflection
in the second-order diffraction by the grating [658]. Thus, the resonant excitation of waveguide
modes under normal light incidence is intrinsically linked to the DBR formation. The latter is
associated with the occurrence of the photonic band gap reflected in the corresponding BIC and
qBIC dispersion branches. The qBIC resonance is accessible at normal incidence, resulting
typically in ultrahigh-𝑄resonances [613]. Note that the excitation of qBIC resonances in
electro-optic metasurfaces, that cannot be avoided in the grating-assisted coupling to waveguide
modes at normal incidence, has already been exploited both explicitly [655] and implicitly [615].
The former (based on the electro-optic polymer) exhibited high modulation efficiency (60%) and
broad bandwidth (3 GHz) when driven by ±100 V [655]. The latter (utilizing environmentally
stable LN films) did not yet reach the same level of performance, but several avenues for the
improvement are clearly in sight [615]. One of the matters to be considered is that strong gratings
enhance not only the Bragg reflection, improving thereby the DBR performance, but also the
out-coupling of waveguide modes, thus increasing the energy dissipation in the system. The
challenge of optimally balancing the metasurface lateral extension and DBR loss to radiation
out-coupling by the grating and absorption by electrodes is yet to be carefully considered from the
viewpoint of reaching the utmost (efficient and fast) performance of electro-optic metasurfaces.
Future developments to address challenges
The general design direction can be formulated as realizing ultrahigh-𝑄resonant transmis-
sion/reflection with the relevant electromagnetic fields efficiently overlapping with the electro-
optic layer and controlling (electrostatic) fields (assuming that the electrostatic field is oriented to
make use of strong components of the electro-optic susceptibility tensor [613]). This requires
minimizing the radiation losses, both by absorption and out-coupling. The former is unavoidable
because of the presence of control electrodes (Fig. 38), but can be decreased by exploiting
transparent conductive materials, e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO) [656], and/or increasing the layer
122


===== PAGE 123 =====
thickness. It should be noted though that electrical characteristics of transparent oxides are
significantly worse than noble metals, and their use might jeopardize the speed of operation,
i.e., the modulation bandwidth. Increasing the dielectric layer thickness would also decrease the
electrode capacitance and thereby increase the modulation bandwidth, but the driving voltage
would proportionally increase as well, resulting in the overall increase of the electrical energy
consumed by the device. Decreasing the radiation loss requires reaching a delicate balance
between the strength of coupling between incident free propagating fields and counter-propagating
waveguide modes and that of Bragg reflection of waveguide modes. Both scattering channels
originate in the diffraction of waveguide modes by the grating, corresponding to the first- and
second-order diffraction, respectively. For the configuration shown in Fig. 38, the design freedom
is limited, since enhancing the scattering strength of individual grating elements (e.g., by making
the metal ridges thicker and wider) would increase the corresponding diffraction efficiencies in
a similar way. In that respect, recently introduced asymmetric (dielectric) gratings, in which
a grating supercell contains several nonidentical grating elements, promise new avenues for
reaching ultrahigh-𝑄coupling (when considering only radiative losses) by decreasing the grating
asymmetry [613,658] and thereby boosting up the performance of electro-optic metasurfaces.
Thus, for example, one can realize vanishingly weak in- and out-coupling diffraction channels,
while maintaining very strong Bragg reflection and thereby forming a high-𝑄DBR for waveguide
modes [658]. It should be emphasized that very strong Bragg reflection implies the possibility of
drastically reducing the grating lateral extension by effectively folding the waveguide propagation
region, while maintaining the same overall resonance quality. This folding has immediate
consequences for the electrode capacitance, which is proportional to the electrode system area,
allowing thereby to drastically increase the operation bandwidth. Concomitantly, the area of
individually addressed metasurface elements making up electro-optic spatiotemporal metasur-
faces for dynamic molding of electromagnetic wavefronts could also be significantly reduced
without loss of efficiency, increasing thus the spatial resolution available for spatiotemporal wave
shaping [659]. Perfecting the operation of electro-optic metasurfaces both as a single array and
as an ensemble of individually addressed metasurface arrays requires different optimization
strategies and targets different application domains. Thus, achieving complete light extinction
with the electro-optic metasurface, and thereby 100% modulation efficiency, would allow one to
realize dynamic phase contrast imaging using the same approach as that demonstrated recently
with static non-local angle-selective metasurfaces [606]. Dynamic functionality would in turn
open other application directions, such as adjustable contouring of images features by gradually
turning on (when applying the electrical control signal) the phase contrast. Combining active
temporal and spatial field modulation with individually addressed arrays would enable unique
optical functionalities, such as frequency mixing, harmonic beam steering and molding, as well
as non-magnetic nonreciprocity among other things [659].
Concluding remarks
The considered configuration of electro-optic nonlocal metasurfaces (Fig. 38) is deceitfully
simple, leaving one wondering about its potential. Indeed, DBRs and associated bandgap
dispersion branches are well known since the 1980s, when being extensively investigated and
exploited for mode selection in distributed feedback semiconductor lasers [660]. However,
the realization of waveguide grating couplers with metal (lossy) electrodes [615], addition
of asymmetry into grating configurations [613,658], making beneficial use of nonlocality in
electromagnetic interactions [527,615] and yet unexplored finite-size effects add up to resulting
in the configuration that is surprisingly reach in physical phenomena and potential applications
as discussed above. It should be noted that the presented here considerations are all concerned
the case of normal light incidence. Deviations from normal incidence would result in the
occurrence of two transmission/reflection minima/maxima (instead of one at normal incidence)
123


===== PAGE 124 =====
corresponding to the coupling at two dispersion branches [658]. This would enable certain
tunability of the operation wavelength by controlling the incident angle close to normal incidence.
This tunability, although limited to the DBR bandgap, is a very interesting (and yet unexplored)
feature of the considered electro-optic nonlocal metasurfaces that should broad and enhance their
application potential. Overall, I believe that many exciting and unexpected developments in this
area are just around the corner, waiting to be discovered and explored.

Cascaded diffractive nonlocal metasurfaces for highly multifunctional meta-
optics
ADAM OVERVIG
Current status
Metasurface optics leveraging nonlocal scattering effects (e.g., interelement coupling) are
emerging as a new frontier for compact optical systems with high information density. Taking
advantage symmetry-breaking design principles and the frequency- and angle-selective responses
of quasi-bound states in the continuum, highly multifunctional meta-optics may be achieved
by cascading several metasurfaces [576,622]. While local metasurface optics often aims for
broadband and angle-insensitive operation, such an approach encodes comparatively negligible
information in the electromagnetic wave compared to having distinct encodings at each frequency
and angle. Nonlocal metasurfaces therefore offer a platform for vastly increasing our command
of light within compact form factors. Most notably, the selectivity and mutual transparency of
several resonant metasurface layers simplifies the design of a cascaded meta-optic; in contrast,
cascaded local meta-optics require redesigning all layers upon the introduction of each new layer.
Hence, cascaded nonlocal meta-optics offers a greatly simplified design space and approach
for highly multifunctional devices. Nonlocal metasurface optics may be distinguished into
two categories [527]: periodic devices that manipulate many plane waves (operating solely
in momentum space), and aperiodic devices that generalize plane wave selectivity to spatial
selectivity (operating in both momentum and real space). The latter are referred to as "diffractive
nonlocal metasurfaces", a generalized category of device encompassing both periodic nonlocal
metasurface or local metasurfaces [576]. Here, we emphasize the potential of a cascaded set of
these devices to encode distinct functionalities across many discrete angles and/or frequencies.
Their nonlocality is engineered through high quality-factor (𝑄-factor) guided resonances, called
quasi-bound states in the continuum, whose dispersion yields a sharp dependence on incident
momentum (encompassing a combination of both angular and frequency selectivity). Meanwhile,
the local scattering of these delocalized modes is controlled similarly to local metasurfaces:
by leveraging the selection rules governing the leakage of these states to free space, tailored
geometric perturbations applied pointwise to each unit cell customizes the response beyond
plane waves, i.e., to any spatial profile of 𝑄-factor, phase, and polarization state. Since the
resulting devices would be periodic but for the applied perturbation, only resonant states interact
strongly with the patterning; non-resonant states only weakly interact. This mechanism results
in high wavelength and frequency selectivity, or "confidentiality", of the response: outside of
resonances, the metasurface behave as unpatterned thin films. By simultaneously engineering
the perturbation and the non-resonant (broadband) response, these devices can operate with
resonant efficiency approaching unity for a reflection peak within a transmission window (i.e., a
stopband filter in which the rejected band is reflected and spatially shaped) [622] or a transmission
peak within a reflection window (i.e., a passband filter with broadband rejection and a spatially
shaped passed band) [661]. With polarization manipulation, a converted state may pass in
transmission while the broadband response is also transmissive, but the maximal efficiency is
25% [576,622]. A closely related class of metasurfaces employs the resonant phase of localized
124


===== PAGE 125 =====
high 𝑄-factor resonators to pattern diffracted light [662, 663]. In these devices, the goal is
frequency selectivity without angular selectivity, conferring high numerical aperture performance.
While there inevitably exists some degree of nonlocality due to the long lifetime of the modes,
flat dispersion can yield a moderate to strong degree of localization. This behavior is compatible
with multi-frequency operation, but not multi-angle operation. In contrast, certain metasurface
approaches have achieved modest angular-dependent wavefront transformation [664,665]. When
rationally designed, these devices are primarily treated as if their unit cell response has angular
dependence, but without explicit introduction of large interelement coupling [664]; when
computationally designed [665], interelement coupling associated with resonances often arises
during optimization. This suggests that rational control of interelement coupling is a crucial tool
for highly multifunctional optics of this kind.
Challenges and opportunities
By leveraging several modes within each metasurface and/or several mutually transparent
metasurfaces cascaded together [622], the future of highly multifunctional cascaded meta-optics
looks highly promising. Here, we suggest a picture for how to consider the potential for these
devices as multi-frequency devices, multi-angle devices, or both; we note that there are many
open questions on the implementation physicality of such systems and nature of the information
encoding in the following, and hope that this viewpoint will motivate efforts to clarify bounds and
constraints on these systems. Figure 39(a) depicts a cascaded meta-optic with multi-frequency
operation. At three frequencies, independent wavefront modulation is imparted at each device
for light incident with a lateral momentum 𝑘in near 0 (near normal incidence). Three example
dispersion profiles are shown in Fig. 39(b), showing three shifted copies of the same mode
(easily achieved by altering the thickness, duty cycle, or period of the metasurface). Each
mode may be locally patterned at will, imparting independent operations to each resonant
frequency [576,622]. Meanwhile, the broadband response is simple transparency (black arrow),
indicating the scalability of this approach to an arbitrary number of frequencies according to: the
bandwidth of the mutual transparency window of the devices, the 𝑄-factors of each device, the
required angular range to encode the desired functionalities, and the acceptable tolerances of the
system. Realization of this vision began in Ref. [622], which showed up to four functionalities.
Beyond this, by using multi-layer nanofabrication, truly dense compound meta-optics with dozens
of wavelengths controlled within a narrow band of operation are possible. Such highly multi-color
meta-optics promise unprecedented capabilities for structured light, spectropolarimetry, and
spatiotemporal pulse shaping. Advances could open opportunities for imaging, augmented reality,
and highly customized light sources.
On the other hand, Fig. 39(c) depicts a cascaded meta-optic with multi-angle operation at a
fixed frequency 𝜔in [Fig. 39(d)]. Compared to Figs. 39(a,b), this approach effectively trades
degrees of freedom from frequency to angle by using the intrinsic spatial dispersion of the
underlying modes [i.e., the very same stack of devices could be used as in Figs. 39(a,b)]. This
scheme breaks the numerical aperture of the meta-optic into a number 𝑁𝑘of small ranges 𝛿𝑘,
each controlled by a distinct mode and/or metasurface layer. Moreover, it will be constrained
by reciprocity: the output waves of each metasurface must be orthogonal to each other, or else
the efficiency will necessarily suffer. Such an approach, if suitably generalized, could extend
the multifunctionality of multi-angle approaches such as Refs. [664,665], greatly increasing the
customizability of a meta-optic at given frequency.
However, the bandwidth and information capacity of such approaches are limited by constraints
such as dispersion and causality. In general, due to the dual nature of frequency and time,
the number 𝑁𝜔of small ranges 𝛿𝜔will vary according to the lifetime 𝜏of the optical modes:
𝑁𝜔∝1/𝛿𝜔∝𝜏, reminiscent of an "uncertainty principle". Here, 𝜏= 𝑄/𝜔𝑟where 𝑄is the
𝑄-factor and 𝜔𝑟is the resonant frequency. This is paralleled in momentum and space, namely:
125


===== PAGE 126 =====
𝑁𝑘∝1/𝛿𝑘∝Re 𝜉, where 𝜉is the (complex) nonlocality length, and 𝜉0 = Re 𝜉characterizes the
in-plane distance a mode travels before radiatively decaying. Moreover, the allowable 𝑁𝑘for a
given bandwidth 𝛿𝜔depends on the nature of dispersion (e.g., parabolic or linear). Figure 40(a)
depicts parabolic dispersion of a resonant frequency 𝜔𝑟with band curvature 𝑏near a band-edge
mode (top), and the linear dispersion with group velocity 𝑣(bottom). The distance 𝜉0 increases
with the square root of lifetime or linearly with lifetime, respectively. Hence, the "diffusive"
transport of a band-edge mode results in increased localization (i.e., decreased 𝜉0) compared
to the "advective" transport of a linear mode with the same 𝜏. In other words, for multi-angle
devices: to increase bandwidth (decrease 𝑄) for the same 𝑁𝑘, a linear dispersion should be used.
While for multi-frequency devices: to increase localization (or range of angles) for a high-𝑄
structure, parabolic dispersion should be used.
While the scheme in Fig. 39 depicts either frequency or angle multifunctionality, the ultimate
case is where both the frequency and angle ranges are independently addressable. In this case,
the total number of independent functionalities grows as 𝑁𝜔𝑁𝑘∝𝜉0𝜏, representing the potential
information density of a cascaded meta-optic [Fig. 40(b)]. Figure 40(c) shows four representative
dispersion relations of the resonant efficiencies for four extreme cases in Fig. 40(b). Note that by
causality, no mode can access the region of Fig. 40(b) such that the distance traveled exceeds the
speed of light 𝑐; we require that 𝜉0 < 𝑐𝜏. A given device platform generally falls in a limited
region of Fig. 40(b); quasi-bound states have proven highly popular because they can rationally
design the lifetime at will using symmetry-breaking concepts, extending their applicability in this
context. A more generalized class of high 𝑄-factor metasurface with both continuously tunable
spectral and angular selectivity, yet locally addressable scattering phase and polarization, is
highly desirable as a tool for both multi-frequency and multi-angle meta-optics. Such a platform
does not exist to our knowledge.
Importantly, we note that the implementation of such an information-dense meta-optic cannot be

achieved for arbitrarily thin systems: the required thickness will grow as the required independent
modes increases. In other words, intuitively, information capacity grows with volume: both
physical aperture size and thickness [649]. In this sense, cascaded diffractive nonlocal meta-optics
amount to a rationally designed scheme for scaling the volume layer-by-layer according to the
desired information capacity.
Future developments to address challenges
To begin to realize this potential information capacity with high efficiency, many challenges must
be overcome. For instance, in contrast to the limitations of Ref. [622], for high efficiency as well
as use of the polarization channels, a transmission mode nonlocal meta-optic should be developed
that resonantly alters light upon transmission within a broadband transparent response. Such a
response has not been demonstrated, yet may be possible with unidirectional guided modes [666],
motivating the incorporation of point-wise symmetry-breaking design principles with directional
control of the leakage of these states. Multi-layer nonlocal metasurfaces have sufficient degrees of
freedom for such a task, and should be a priority in future research. Moreover, while flat bands and
linear bands are achievable within periodic flat optics, even within a single system via a rational
design paradigm [667], such approaches have not been shown to be compatible with spatially
aperiodic functions of phase and polarization. A "knob" to tune the spatial dispersion that does
not conflict with the knobs that spatially control the phase and polarization is highly desirable to
create flexible cascaded meta-optics over a wide range of angular selectivity responses. While
the primary message here has been to point to the ceiling of potential information capacity, full
access to the full information space is not realistic in the near term; practical choices should be
made to make tangible progress. We believe that the potential information capacity of current
high-𝑄and nonlocal metasurfaces is often too high as a starting point, and as a result the
127


===== PAGE 128 =====
implementation is not sufficiently flexible; the sensitivities to experimental and design errors may
inhibit progress. That is, we argue that we should first seek individual nonlocal metasurfaces
associated with less information capacity (i.e., smaller 𝜉0 and 𝜏) for use in cascaded meta-optics,
and then increase the capacity of each layer in the future as processes mature. For instance,
while linear dispersion is optimal for extreme values of 𝑁𝑘for a given bandwidth, the moderate
localization of a band-edge mode affords tolerances to experimental and design errors that a
linear dispersion does not. Hence, parabolic bands are more practical for low to moderate 𝑁𝑘.
Unfortunately, if the band edge mode of a system is limited to normal incidence, only one
such mode may be used for a given operating frequency. This motivates the incorporation of
custom band-edge angles [668] with spatially aperiodic perturbations. Moreover, while high
𝑄-factors are attractive for information density, practical experimental considerations often limit
𝑄-factors to moderate values of less than 103 or suffer drastically from low efficiency. Ideally,
for exploration of proofs-of-principle and for robust, high-efficiency operation over moderate
bandwidths, the radiative 𝑄-factor would be lower than 100; it is well-known how to increase it
later. That is, an arbitrarily high 𝑄-factor may be designed using quasi-bound state concepts,
yet the symmetry-breaking approach of quasi-bound states often has a practical lower bound in
𝑄-factor. This can be simply understood as follows: larger symmetry breaking perturbations
yield lower 𝑄-factor, but a geometric perturbation has an upper bound before geometric features
overlap each other. Future efforts lowering the 𝑄in diffractive nonlocal metasurfaces will
offer increased reliability and flexibility in the design space of Fig. 40(b) while maintaining the
symmetry-based pointwise control of light afforded by the selection rules.
Concluding remarks
While local meta-optics have been ushering in unprecedented information density encoded at will
into flat optical devices, the new frontier of cascaded diffractive nonlocal meta-optics reveals that
the local approach only begins to scratch the surface of what is possible. In nonlocal metasurfaces,
selectivity to incident frequency and/or angle is possible. In diffractive nonlocal metasurfaces,
the spatial customization of amplitude, phase, and polarization may be retained in addition to
this selectivity. Here, we have emphasized that in cascaded diffractive nonlocal meta-optics, the
non-resonant transparency of each layer renders each selectively encoded functionality mutually
transparent (orthogonal) to one another, establishing a scalable approach to highly multifunctional
meta-optics. Such an approach amounts to volumetric metamaterials composed of many two-
dimensional layers that are rationally designed to achieve unprecedented customizability of
light. Success in these endeavors promises advances across optics, including spectrospatial
structuring of light, optical computing, and dense holographic data storage. Beyond linear
optics, the strong light-matter interactions of the customized high 𝑄-factor responses promise
new pathways for highly efficient and multifunctional reconfigurable, nonlinear, and quantum
volumetric metamaterials that are designable and manufacturable with standard procedures.

Role of nonlocality in topological metamaterials
FILIPA R. PRUDÊNCIO

Current status
Topological photonics is an exciting and rapidly advancing field that brings the mathematical
elegance of topology into the realm of electromagnetic waves and photonic materials [669,670].
At its heart lies the principle of bulk-edge correspondence, a profound result that serves as
128


===== PAGE 129 =====
the cornerstone of the field’s theoretical framework and practical applications. This principle
states that the topological invariants, which are properties of the bulk band structure, dictate the
existence and robustness of edge states that propagate along the material boundary [671]. From a
practical standpoint, the bulk-edge correspondence manifests as a remarkable conservation law:
at the junction of different topological materials, all of which share a band gap, the number of
edge states propagating toward the junction must precisely equal the number of edge states leaving
it [Fig. 41(a)] [671]. This conservation law ensures that waves traveling along such boundaries
follow well-defined pathways, dictated by the topological invariants of the materials. If this
correspondence were violated—if, for instance, there were more states entering the junction than
leaving—it would imply the presence of a singular behavior in conservative systems [671–673].
Such a scenario might correspond to the material acting as an electromagnetic sink, where light
could enter but not escape [Fig. 41(b)]. The absence of such singularities is a fundamental feature
of nature’s physical laws and reflects the robustness of topological protection in these systems.

In a topological system, the number of incoming edge channels and the number of
outgoing edge channels is exactly the same. (b) A system with an ill-defined topology
is not bound by the constraint in panel (a). The ill-defined topology can be used to

enhancement. Adapted with permission from Ref. [673] (Copyright © 2022 SPIE).
However, this robustness relies on subtle physical mechanisms, and it is here that nonlocality
plays a critical role. Nonlocality refers to a material’s response that depends not only on
the electromagnetic field at a given point but also on its spatial variations. In plasmonics, a
well-known example of nonlocality is found in the drift-diffusion (hydrodynamic) model, where
electron-electron repulsive interactions effectively establish a minimum localization length,
thereby preventing extreme wave localization. Thus, diffusion effects inherently counteract
forms of field localization that might otherwise compromise the integrity of the bulk-edge
correspondence. In the context of topological metamaterials, nonlocality becomes more than
a secondary effect: it is an essential feature. Nonlocal effects act as the key mechanism that
ensures singularities, such as electromagnetic sinks, are naturally avoided. By mediating how the
response to fast varying fields tailors the material’s photonic structure, nonlocality enforces the
constraints required for bulk-edge correspondence to hold universally.
Challenges and opportunities
The Chern theorem applies strictly to closed manifolds, which initially suggests that electromag-
netic continua—systems without intrinsic periodicity—are unsuitable for nontrivial photonic
topologies. For example, early studies revealed a fundamental challenge: conventional local
129


===== PAGE 130 =====
models of materials, such as magnetically biased plasmas or ferrites, fail to produce a well-defined
topological classification. This deficiency is attributed to the noncompact nature of the wavevector
space in electromagnetic continua, which is identified with the Euclidean plane [674]. However,
recent advances reveal that nonlocality can relax these constraints, serving as a foundational
approach to resolve such issues [516,674,675]. Specifically, by introducing a dependence of the
material response on the wavevector 𝒌, nonlocal models can effectively suppress nonreciprocal
responses at large 𝒌[674]. This suppression eliminates the problematic contributions from high-𝒌
modes, ensuring that the band gaps in electromagnetic continua have well-defined topological
invariants.
Interestingly, the importance of nonlocal effects extends beyond electromagnetic continua
to periodic systems such as photonic crystals [676]. In these systems, the wavevector space is
isomorphic to a torus and thus naturally satisfies the conditions of the Chern theorem. Nonetheless,
the topology of photonic crystals can also become ill-defined when the nonlocal response of the
materials is disregarded. This issue arises from the bosonic nature of electromagnetic waves,
which gives photonic band structures properties that differ fundamentally from those of electronic
band structures. Unlike electronic systems, which have a well-defined ground state (a finite
number of bands below the Fermi level), photonic systems exhibit spectra that are unbounded
from below. This property stems from the real symmetry of the electromagnetic field, which
enforces a particle-hole symmetry in the spectrum: for every positive frequency mode, there is
a corresponding negative frequency partner. Consequently, photonic systems always have an
infinite number of bands below any given bandgap. This feature places the Chern theorem in a
precarious position, as it traditionally relies on having a finite number of bands below the gap to
compute the topological invariants.
This issue can be vividly illustrated with an example. Consider a system with an infinite
number of isolated bands below a gap, each contributing alternately +1 or −1 to the Chern
number [676,677]. The gap Chern number in this case is given by the non-convergent series
𝒞gap = 1 + (−1) + 1 + (−1) + . . ., resulting in an ill-defined topology. Additionally, material
dispersion can exacerbate the problem. For example, the combination of a flat band in a material
and the band folding induced by periodicity can result in an accumulation of an infinite number
of bands at certain resonance frequencies. This accumulation creates further challenges, as the
corresponding contributions to the Chern number may again form a divergent series [676].
As is well-known, an infinite sum of integers converges only if all but a finite number of terms
are zero. Without a mechanism to suppress contributions from high-𝒌modes or to regulate
the effects of band folding and dispersion, the topology of photonic systems cannot be reliably
defined. Here again, nonlocality offers an elegant solution. By introducing a wavevector cutoff
that suppresses nonreciprocal responses at large 𝒌, nonlocal effects provide the regularization
needed to resolve these ambiguities. This ensures that the band gaps in realistic dispersive
photonic crystals have well-defined topological invariants, allowing them to serve as robust
platforms for topological photonics [676].
Future developments to address challenges
Despite the important role of nonlocal effects in ensuring well-defined topologies in photonic
systems, several challenges remain to be addressed. One critical issue is the limited knowledge
of the material response at high wavevectors 𝒌, as most physical models are developed for
small 𝒌, corresponding to long-wavelength physics. The behavior of materials at high 𝒌, which
governs short-wavelength phenomena, is often poorly characterized, leading to uncertainties in
the topological classification of materials.
It has been shown that the topology of a material critically depends on its high-𝒌response and
that different types of nonlocality can lead to entirely different topological phases [516,676]. This
concept can be geometrically visualized using an analogy with the theory of surfaces. Imagine a

torus with a vanishing inner radius, which forms a cusp at its center, as illustrated in Fig. 42(aii).
Mathematically, the cusp introduces a nondifferentiable point, rendering the topology ill-defined.
This issue is resolved by an infinitesimal deformation: either making the inner radius finite,
creating a torus with genus one, or severing the cusp, yielding a sphere with genus zero.
This analogy underscores that different perturbations can regularize an ill-defined topology,
yielding different topological invariants.
In photonic systems, starting with an ill-defined
topology (e.g., a local material model), various types of nonlocality can similarly create distinct
topological phases (Fig. 42). For example, mechanisms like diffusion, odd viscosity, or full
wavevector cutoffs have all been proposed to regularize the topology of materials [516,674,678].
However, this raises a critical issue: the exact nature of the nonlocal response—and therefore
the resulting topology—often depends on assumptions about the high-𝒌behavior, which is not
always experimentally or theoretically well-constrained.
Importantly, similar to the topological properties, the number of unidirectional edge state
channels also depends on the specific form of nonlocality controlling the material response [679–
682]. The number of unidirectional edge states consistently aligns with the predictions of the
bulk-edge correspondence [681,682]. While this may seem problematic, such ambiguity often
affects only very short-wavelength waves. Fortunately, dissipation tends to suppress contributions
from these short wavelengths, ensuring that in practical scenarios the physical response remains
consistent across different nonlocal models.
Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the
mechanisms that determine the nonlocal responses at high-𝒌in weakly dissipative systems
remains an open problem.
Another significant challenge lies in extending the bulk-edge correspondence to non-Hermitian
systems, such as those with loss and gain. Recent studies have demonstrated that in active systems,
the bulk-edge correspondence can fail due to the non-Hermitian skin effect. In such systems,
the bulk spectrum can change dramatically when switching from periodic to open boundary
131


===== PAGE 132 =====
conditions, due to wave localization along specific boundaries. An open question is whether it
is possible to identify a subclass of non-Hermitian systems where bulk-edge correspondence
can be preserved. For instance, could the correspondence be constrained to dissipative systems
(with only loss) or stable systems (with the spectrum in the lower-half complex frequency plane)?
Understanding these conditions could open new avenues for topological photonics, particularly in
active and non-equilibrium platforms. Nonlocality, with its ability to mediate high-𝒌responses,
may play a crucial role in addressing these challenges, potentially enabling robust bulk-edge
correspondence even in non-Hermitian contexts.
Concluding Remarks
Understanding and incorporating nonlocality into the design and analysis of photonic topological
metamaterials is not merely an academic exercise but a practical necessity. It provides the
physical mechanism that underpins the robustness of topological edge states, ensuring that light
retains its predictable and protected pathways. Nonlocality, in this sense, serves as the bridge
between the abstract mathematical elegance of topology and the physical reality of photonic
materials, safeguarding the interplay of edge states and topological invariants that makes this
field so vibrant.

Nonlocality in nonreciprocal plasmonics
S. ALI HASSANI GANGARAJ
& CHRISTOS ARGYROPOULOS
Current status
Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be excited along metal-dielectric interfaces giving rise to
the emerging field of plasmonics. While most plasmonic systems are reciprocal, unidirectional
(nonreciprocal) SPPs can be realized by biasing metallic media with a quantity that is odd
under time reversal symmetry, typically a static magnetic field. For instance, one-way SPPs can
be induced along the surface of magnetized highly doped semiconductors (acting as metals).
Interestingly, the realization of nonreciprocal SPPs may lead to extreme wave physics phenomena
which, however, cannot be characterized correctly unless nonlocality (a.k.a., spatial dispersion)
is included in the analysis [680]. One method to achieve nonreciprocal SPP propagation is by
introducing asymmetry in the conventional SPP flat dispersion band at the surface plasmon
resonance. This is done by interfacing a magnetized plasmonic material with a transparent
dielectric, leading to asymmetrical SPP dispersion bands. However, recently [680], it was argued
that the presence of a flat asymptote band leads to a thermodynamic paradox, i.e., infinite photonic
states, 𝑘∈(𝑘min, ∞) within the unidirectional SPP frequency range 𝜔∈(𝜔−
SP, 𝜔+
SP), resulting in
infinite energy at finite temperatures. This issue arises from the locality assumption implying that
the material stays polarized even near asymptotes where SPP modes have diverging wavenumbers.
Interestingly, the inclusion of nonlocality corrects this unphysical behavior since it bends the
dispersion upwards at large wavenumbers and close the nonreciprocal window, as depicted in
Fig. 43(a), leading to asymmetric SPP propagation but in all directions [679]. Another type of
unidirectional SPP is realized by interfacing a magnetized plasma with an opaque material. Here,
one-way propagation stems from asymmetric cutoff at 𝒌= 0 for counter-propagating modes
in the plasmonic bandgap, rather than asymmetric asymptotes described before, as shown in
Fig. 43(b). This type of nonreciprocal SPPs remain unaffected by the strong nonlocality in biased
semiconductors, such as indium antimonide (InSb), mainly due to the topological properties
of the resulted magnetized plasma [679]. While topological protection suggests robustness
against nonlocality, there are instances where nonlocality violates bulk-edge correspondence in
topological photonics. One violation occurs when a magnetic wall on a magnetized semiconductor
"short-circuits" the tangential SPP magnetic field [Fig. 43(c)], preventing SPP existence despite
132


===== PAGE 133 =====
a non-zero gap Chern number difference. However, it was proven that SPP theoretically exists
only at diverging wavenumbers [672]. Incorporating nonlocality keeps the SPP wavenumber
large but finite, formally restoring bulk-edge correspondence. Nonetheless, SPPs with large
wavenumbers are hard to excite and suffer attenuation due to Landau damping, even when
lossless materials are considered [672]. The second violation of bulk-edge correspondence
occurs when SPP dispersion does not span the entire bandgap due to an opaque material with
a plasma frequency near the upper bandgap edge, causing an asymptote within the bandgap
[Fig. 43(d)].
While the lower bandgap supports a topological state, no edge mode exists
in the upper portion, violating the principle. Including nonlocality in InSb response bends
the SPP band asymptote upward, leading to SPP leakage into the bulk of InSb [672]. This
nonlocality-induced radiation loss quickly attenuates SPP power. Thus, while nonlocality restores
bulk-edge correspondence, it is violated practically as SPPs are immediately attenuated, even
in lossless materials. Hence, nonlocality’s role should be treated cautiously in nonreciprocal
plasmonic systems. The results in Ref. [672] clarify that although nonlocality does not break the
unidirectionality of topological SPPs, we still need to consider the material spatial dispersion in
our analysis to prevent paradoxical observations such as bulk-edge correspondence violation. The
above discussion highlights the role of nonlocality in nonreciprocal plasmonics and paves the way
to future experimental observations. By leveraging nonreciprocal SPPs via realistic materials,
one can develop highly efficient and more compact, directionally controlled novel light transport
systems, which promise to be fundamental components of envisioned advanced classical and
quantum photonic technologies. Hence, nonreciprocal plasmonics offers a versatile tool for
fine-tuning the nanophotonic device performance with applications in different technological
frontiers, such as communication and computing.
Challenges and opportunities
The investigation of nonlocal effects in nonreciprocal plasmonics is still in its infancy. The
discussion presented above indicates that accounting for material nonlocality gives rise to complex
wave phenomena, playing a crucial role in the nonreciprocity of the induced surface modes.
While these findings highlight the potential of nonreciprocity to control light propagation in
unprecedented ways, they also underscore the growing need to practically realize this effect by
using new photonic systems. Currently, the predominant method for achieving such response
remains heavily reliant on magneto-optical effects that require static magnetic field bias. The
inherent weaknesses of magneto-optical effects, along with the sensitivity of one-way SPP
propagation achieved by this method to nonlocality, raise major concerns about the practical
applicability of nonreciprocal plasmonics. Drifting electrons resulting in current bias is also
an odd quantity under time reversal symmetry, similar to magnetic field. Therefore, instead of
magnetic bias, one may use currents in both bulk conducting media (metals, semiconductors,
and plasmas) and emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. The origin of this
nonreciprocal effect is rooted in the Doppler effect due to the electrons’ movement along the
medium, which produces a Doppler frequency shift (𝜔→𝜔−𝒌· 𝒗𝑑) in the material optical
response, where 𝒌is the wavenumber and 𝒗𝑑is the drifting velocity [524]. The wavenumber
inclusion in the material response indicates a form of nonlocality that can lead to nonreciprocity.
Although the inclusion of material’s natural nonlocality challenges the nonreciprocal response of
plasmonics, paradoxically, induced nonlocality via current bias provides opportunities to achieve
this response. The nonlocality-induced nonreciprocity can be intuitively explained as follows:
SPPs involve collective electron-photon oscillations. When these modes are dragged or opposed
by the drifting electrons, SPPs "see" different media when propagating along or against the current
flow, i.e., 𝜔(𝒌) ≠𝜔(−𝒌). Different platforms can be used to demonstrate nonlocality-induced
nonreciprocity. Recently, nonreciprocal SPPs propagation along a gold nanowire carrying a small
electric current with a drift velocity around 𝑣𝑑/𝑐0 ≈10−6 was demonstrated [524]. Another work
133


===== PAGE 134 =====
studied n-type InSb which allowed for even larger drift velocities up to 𝑣𝑑/𝑐0 ≈10−3 [683]. The
latter study was focused not only on nonreciprocal SPP propagation, but also on the excitation of
slow light, steerable SPPs, and exceptional point-like mode transitions at dispersion inflection
points. Such nonlocality-induced nonreciprocity can be utilized in thermal photonics, specifically
to enable nonreciprocal near-field radiative heat transfer between two planar bodies. Graphene
has also emerged as a promising material for nonlocality-induced nonreciprocal plasmonics.
Recent experiments demonstrated nonreciprocity with electrons drifting at speeds around its
Fermi velocity [684]. Interestingly, a relevant theoretical work [685] highlighted the potential of
nonlocality-induced nonreciprocity in enhancing nonlinear light-matter interactions in graphene
plasmonics. By utilizing drifting electrons induced by current on a voltage-biased graphene sheet
placed on a periodically corrugated silicon (Si) grating, it is possible to create asymmetric SPP
modes with field enhancement shown in Fig. 44(a). Blocking the path of nonreciprocal SPPs
enables the generation of dramatically enhanced and localized broadband electric field hotspots
near the termination, since the radiation cannot be reflected back, with the intensity of these
hotspots controlled by the speed of the drifting electrons. The resulted energy accumulation can
significantly enhance third-order nonlinear optical effects in graphene, with predicted conversion
efficiencies of up to 0.3% around the plasmon resonance frequency [685].
Future developments to address challenges
Plasmonic systems exhibit unique properties, such as subwavelength confinement and strong field
enhancement, making them ideal solutions to realize nanophotonic technologies. One of their key
features is the extreme enhancement of nonlinear light-matter interactions [686]. In this context,
two general strategies are employed traditionally to generate strong electric field enhancement:
i) localized resonances and ii) slow-light effects with adiabatic impedance matching. However,
these methods suffer from sensitivity to material absorption losses, limited bandwidth, and large
device footprint due to the very long adiabatically tapered structures.
An alternative strategy to address these technological challenges is the use of terminated
nonreciprocal plasmonic waveguides to enhance weak optical nonlinear effects. Towards this end,
strong electric field hot spots were demonstrated [687] when the unidirectional SPP propagation is
blocked suitably in a nonreciprocal plasmonic waveguide made of Si and magnetically biased InSb
with results depicted in Fig. 44(b). The obtained large and broadband electric field enhancement
is ideal to boost the efficiency of various optical nonlinear processes. Additionally, impedance
matching is automatically guaranteed in this nonreciprocal waveguide configuration due to
the absence of a backward mode, eliminating the need for long adiabatic structures, hence,
substantially reducing the device footprint. While plasmonic effects are typically constrained
by material loss, in the limit of negligible material loss, other effects — such as nonlocality-
induced surface-to-bulk mode coupling — can become a primary limitation on field localization.
However, recent studies have shown that electric field hot spots achieved based on this method
can lead to substantial second [688] and third [687] harmonic generation enhancement. As
previously outlined, the weak magnetic response of materials at optical frequencies limits the
effectiveness of magnetic bias for this purpose. These technological challenges necessitate
concerted efforts to advance the underlying platforms. Drifting electrons offer an alternative
method to break time reversal symmetry. Achieving such nonlocality-induced nonreciprocity
requires high current bias values, which, although difficult, are not experimentally unattainable,
as was recently confirmed in Ref. [684] through the demonstration of Fizeau drag in graphene.
Nonlocality-induced nonreciprocity holds great promise for classical nanophotonic technologies,
offering enhancement in both linear and nonlinear light-matter interactions.
Similarly, in
the realm of quantum technologies, nonreciprocal nanophotonic media can provide benefits,
such as enhancing interactions between two-level emitters (e.g., atoms, molecules, quantum
dots). This improved interaction between two-level emitters can serve as a key mechanism

for boosting inter-atomic energy transport efficiency [689] and entanglement [690]. Such
advances could, in turn, enable the generation and mediation of entanglement in multipartite
systems, consisting a fundamental objective in quantum technology. Although much of the
theory behind nonlocal nonreciprocal systems has been developed, offering a glimpse to various
potential groundbreaking applications, experiments of the presented effects are still lagging. The

drift current-biased or magneto-optical, is predicted to be an ongoing active research area in
the broad fields of photonics and optics. Efficient operation is required for these nonreciprocal

Concluding Remarks
The above discussion provides a glimpse into how nonlocality and its effects on nonreciprocal
plasmonics are crucial not only to advance classical photonic processes, such as enhancing linear
and nonlinear light-matter interactions and one-way waveguiding, but also in quantum optics,
where induced nonlocality may enable more efficient interactions in multipartite emitter systems.
Nonlocal effects are essential for correcting the unphysical behavior arising in nonreciprocal
plasmonic systems, particularly when one-way SPPs rely on asymmetric dispersion asymptotes
that could otherwise lead to thermodynamic paradoxes. However, this resolution may come at
the cost of SPP unidirectionality, unless the one-way behavior originates from the nontrivial
topological properties of the underlying platform, such as in the case of magnetized plasma-like
materials. Although nonlocality can challenge nonreciprocal plasmonics in extreme cases, it
also offers opportunities to achieve one-way propagation through nonlocality-induced effects.
Introducing nonlocality via drifting electrons presents a promising alternative for creating a
one-way path for edge states, particularly in semiconductors (n-type InSb) or emerging 2D
conductive materials such as graphene. Future work should focus on optimizing these nonlocal
effects, exploring innovative natural or artificial materials with strong nonreciprocal properties,
and incorporating these advances into practical photonic devices for both classical and quantum
optical applications.

Nonlocal effects in singular plasmonic geometries unveiled by transforma-
tion optics
PALOMA A. HUIDOBRO
, EMANUELE GALIFFI
, FAN YANG
&
JOHN B. PENDRY
Current status
Transformation optics (TO) has played a pivotal role in advancing metamaterials research [691].
This theoretical framework exploits the form-invariance of Maxwell’s equations under coordinate
transformations to prescribe the spatial tailoring of electromagnetic constitutive parameters that
have to be implemented in a metamaterial in order to obtain a desired optical effect. Being a very
general theory framework, TO has also been used as a design tool for nanoplasmonic structures.
By concentrating light within subwavelength volumes, plasmonic nanostructures act as nanoscale
light harvesters. At optical frequencies, free electrons in plasmonic materials interact with
incident electromagnetic fields forming surface plasmon polaritons that oscillate with much
shorter wavelengths than incident radiation. These nanostructures concentrate light at nanometer
length scales, with the strongest localization occurring in singular plasmonic structures, that
feature sharp edges, nanometer-sized gaps, or touching points, towards which the surface plasmon
polaritons carry electromagnetic energy. Examples include nanotips, nanocrescents and touching
spheres, shown in Fig. 45(a), as well as gratings with sharp edges or almost touching points,
shown in Fig. 45(b). As the surface plasmon travels towards, e.g., the edge of a nanotip, its
wavelength shrinks and the energy density is localized [see Fig. 45(c)]. In an ideal, lossless
system, this generates singular hot spots where the intensity of electromagnetic fields diverges.
TO brings further insight into this process by revealing "hidden symmetries" by relating a
structure with no apparent symmetry to another more symmetrical one. For example: a cylinder
can be transformed into a plane which explains degeneracy of the plasmonic modes of a cylinder.
According to this framework, all the singular structures shown in Fig. 45 can be transformed
into an extended and nonsingular one: a planar waveguide for the geometries in panel (a) and
the smooth grating in (b), and a waveguide array for the grating with sharp singularities in (c).
Additionally, TO is not limited to the strict quasistatic limit, and radiative corrections can be
incorporated in the theory to accurately deal with larger structures.
We can thus exploit this connection to predict the optical response of a structure of interest by
studying the modes in a highly symmetric structure, which allows for an analytical treatment [692].
For instance, in a planar waveguide (or waveguide array), surface plasmons excited at the origin
travel away towards infinity. Singular coordinate transformations map infinity into singular
points in the frame of a localized or grating structure. Consequently, all singular structures
share a broadband optical spectrum associated with the energy build up at the singular points.
Interestingly, in the case of gratings, this can be understood as the compacting of one of the
dimensions of the non-singular structure into the singularities [693]. Huge concentrations of
electromagnetic energy at nanoscale volumes can then be exploited for highly sensitive sensing
or improved photovoltaic devices.
However, this immense energy concentration has limits. Fields cannot be confined beyond
the electronic screening length, where nonlocal effects come into play and impose a limit
to the achievable field enhancement with these light harvesting structures. The dynamics of
the free carriers in plasmonic media, which mediate a response to incident electromagnetic
fields over finite distances, explain the failure of the local response approximation of classical
electrodynamics.

===== PAGE 138 =====
Challenges and opportunities
The diverging field concentrations in singular (or near-singular) plasmonic nanostructures, as
well as the optically small length scales involved in the nonlocal response, make most theoretical
approaches challenging or even inapplicable. For instance, numerical methods are limited by the
size of the finite elements used to spatially discretize a structure. These must be smaller than
the length scales involved in the problem, which prevents from realizing a singular point. On
the contrary, the analytical nature of TO makes it an ideal tool for dealing with these singular
structures, by exploiting the fact that they can be mapped to extended, non-singular structures.
This capability, together with the insight provided by TO, represents a unique opportunity to
understand the key role played by nonlocal effects in singular plasmonic geometries.
Reference [49] showed that nonlocal effects can be incorporated into the TO framework by
considering a hydrodynamic description of the free carriers. Within this model, electron-electron
interactions result in a wave-vector dependent, spatially dispersive, dielectric function for longi-
tudinal modes. This reflects the fact that incident electromagnetic fields can excite longitudinal

plasmon oscillations that are not described in the common local response approximation. As a
result, surface charges accumulate on a finite-length layer with a non-vanishing decay length
[see purple area in the sketch of Fig. 45(d), representing two touching nanowires]. The existence
of this layer smooths out any singularity and has critical implications on the field enhancement
capabilities and the optical response of these structures.
An example of field localization calculated by means of TO is shown in Fig. 45(c) for the case
of a plasmonic nanotip [72]. Under a local-response approximation (top panel), the wavelength
of the surface plasmons shrinks as they travel towards the singularity, a point that is never reached
as it corresponds to infinity in the other frame. In contrast, when spatial dispersion in the metal
is included, the tip effectively blunts, quantizing the modes, and limiting the smallest achievable
wavelength for the surface plasmons (bottom panel).
Figure 45(d) displays the optical response (absorption cross section) of two touching nanowires
calculated by means of TO. In a local approximation (grey line), the singular nature of this
structure results in a broad absorption peak due to its continuous spectrum. On the other hand,
mode quantization due to nonlocality results in a series of discrete absorption peaks (blue, green
and red lines for different values of the nonlocal decay length). In sharp contrast, for the case of a
single nanowire (black lines), nonlocality only results in a blueshift (dashed line).
TO also presents opportunities to understand singularities in plasmonic gratings. Subwave-
length arrays of sharp grooves etched into metallic surfaces, such as gold (Au) or silver (Ag),
convert these materials from efficient reflectors into good broadband absorbers. TO reveals how
the surface plasmons localized at the two-dimensional (2D) surface have a three-dimensional
(3D) nature with an additional wave-vector inherited from the transformed structure compacted
into the singularities [693]. The missing selection rule for this extra wave-vector produces a
broadband absorption spectrum, unlike conventional gratings with discrete absorption lines.
Figure 45(e) shows the broadband spectral response of a local singular silver metasurface with a
10 nm period calculated analytically with TO: a small decrease in reflectivity is seen for a broad
band. By contrast, when nonlocality is considered, the spectrum splits into a discrete series of
peaks with very low reflectivity, thus high absorption [694].
Future developments to address challenges
So far, most approaches to nonlocality using TO have been limited to the hard wall approximation
and the hydrodynamic model. However, this fails to account for spill-out of the electronic
density away from the metal. These nonclassical spill-out effects can be incorporated to the
TO framework by combining Feibelman 𝑑-parameters [311]. This relies on introducing the
electronic scale length through the modification of the classical boundary conditions with the
Feibelman 𝑑-parameters (see Sec. 12 of this Roadmap). These are a set of mesoscopic complex
surface-response functions which play a role analogous to the local bulk permittivity, but for
interfaces between two materials [260].
The approach of Ref. [311] combines the analytical power of TO with the capability of this
mesoscopic model to accurately incorporate nonlocality, spill-out, and surface-enabled losses.
Fig. 46(b) shows the absorption efficiency spectra of two almost touching nanowires. While the
hard-wall hydrodynamic model predicts a blueshift of the first resonance peak, the nonclassical,
mesoscopic calculation predicts a redshift and the appearance of the Bennet mode (see inset
panel), showing how this approach successfully captures both electron spill-out and nonlocal
effects.
On the other hand, tunneling and size quantization are not contemplated within this model.
Therefore, an outstanding challenge would be to incorporate these effects into the TO approach.
This would be relevant for optical nanostructures with the sharpest singularities, since these
effects are important for feature sizes below about 1 nm [260].
Furthermore, there are plasmonic materials beyond metals, and TO can be extended to treat

them [697]. For instance, graphene, the paradigmatic example of a two-dimensional material,
hosts surface plasmons when doped. Interestingly, singular plasmonic gratings can be realized
on graphene by having periodic conductivity modulations that approach zero at the grating
minima, see Fig. 46(a). Under THz illumination, this monoatomic structure shows a broad
absorption band. The stronger the suppression of conductivity at the grating valleys, the more
broadband the absorption spectrum is [693]. Ref. [695] showed how, under a semiclassical
description of graphene’s conductivity (a local analogue model), these conductivity gratings
could probe the nonlocal response of graphene by far field measurements only. However, quantum
calculations have found that plasmon propagation is damped by strong modulations of the local
Fermi energy [698], pointing to the need to implement fully quantum conductivity models within
optical calculations, where TO can be of help.
Finally, if TO is to be employed for devising applications, further advances are needed to treat
more complex structures. For instance, TO-inspired singular plasmonic nanospheres have been
proposed for catalysis applications at metal-semiconductor interfaces [696]. Three-dimensional
hybrid nanostructures with plasmonic singularities, see Fig. 46(c), were shown to provide broad
and strong light harvesting at the active site of the semiconductor, facilitating a chemical reaction.
However, these and other fully three-dimensional structures are challenging to model with TO,
with only a few examples of nanosphere dimers having been developed in the literature [699].

Concluding remarks
Combining the TO framework with nonlocal hydrodynamic or nonclassical mesoscopic models
offers a powerful tool to unveil the effect of spatial dispersion, electron spill out or surface-enabled
losses in nanoplasmonic structures. These effects are especially important in singular or near
singular geometries where TO is particularly interesting, as it can treat structures that are
commonly very challenging to simulate. Additionally, TO is able to uncover the geometrical
basis of their optical response, by linking hotspots of field concentration in these systems with
points at infinity in partner structures, to which surface plasmons travel. In conclusion, TO
enables analytical calculations in complex geometries, in the presence of nonlocal and retarded
effects. This makes TO a critical tool to understand nonlocal effects in plasmonics.

The concept of overlapping nonlocality and the ultimate thickness limits of
optics
DAVID A. B. MILLER
Current status
In many optical and wave systems, the output at a given point or pixel depends on the input at
many other points or pixels, which we could regard as a definition of nonlocal behavior [527,576].
For example, in an imager, the light on one output image pixel depends on the light over the
entire input surface of the lens [649]. However, the light on another output pixel also depends on
the input light over the same entire input lens surface. So, these nonlocalities are "overlapping".
Such overlapping nonlocalities [649] can be found in many other systems, including metasurfaces
for image differentiation [700] or space compression [639]; there, too, multiple adjacent input
pixels contribute to each output pixel (Fig. 47).
To understand overlapping nonlocality, we can imagine making a cut through both the input
and output surfaces, which will define a "transverse aperture" in the optics (Fig. 47). The key idea
here is that, for the device to do what we want, some number 𝐶– the overlapping nonlocality [649]
– of independent channels must pass through this transverse aperture from side to side. Because
we believe that physically we can only get so many propagating channels through some finite
cross-section (e.g., the number of waveguide modes that could fit in that cross-section), this
transverse aperture must be large enough to carry this number 𝐶of channels.
This idea of overlapping nonlocality addresses a key question that is particularly important for
metastructures: can we do what we want with just a single layer of material or metamaterial?
Or, more generally, just how much thickness will that structure need? This approach also gives
bounds for the thickness of imagers, for example [649]. Note that, as in Fig. 47(d), any given
channel could be collecting from a large number 𝑄of input pixels, and we could regard 𝑄as the
(simple) "nonlocality". (To distinguish from nonlocality as a physical distance, we could call 𝑄
the "nonlocality number" of the channel.) The overlapping nonlocality 𝐶is not the same as 𝑄; 𝐶
depends on the number of separate output channels that much be constructed from those same
input pixels.
This overlapping nonlocality can be precisely specified mathematically. Some matrix 𝐷
describes the mathematical mapping between input pixels (which feed matrix columns) and
output pixels (which are fed by matrix rows) (Fig. 48). We can write that matrix so that all the
columns for pixels on the "left" of the dividing surface are to the "left" of some vertical line
through the matrix, and similarly the rows for all output pixels to the "left" of the dividing surface
are "above" some horizontal line through the matrix. This defines the "quadrant" sub-matrices
𝐷LR for "left-inputs-to-right-outputs" and 𝐷RL for "right-inputs-to-left-outputs". We can view
optical systems quite generally as mode converters [701,702], mapping one set of orthogonal
input functions one-by-one to orthogonal output functions; these pair of functions – one each
141


===== PAGE 142 =====
in the input and output spaces – form the mode-converter (or communication mode) basis sets
for the system. If we know the desired matrix 𝐷for the system, we can establish these pairs
of functions by singular value decomposition of 𝐷, a standard matrix operation. Importantly,
this process, through the resulting singular values, also gives the coupling strengths of these
pairs. From this process, we can establish just how many such couplings are really needed, above
some coupling strength we consider negligibly weak. (Quite generally [703], such couplings
anyway fall off rapidly past some finite number in physical wave systems.) For our matrices
𝐷LR and 𝐷RL, we can therefore deduce numbers of channels 𝐶LR and 𝐶RL needed in each case.
Reciprocity [649] requires we add these numbers to get the required overlapping nonlocality
𝐶= 𝐶LR + 𝐶RL.
The number 𝐶arguably then can tell us a thickness of some optical element, based on a
"maximum number of modes" conjecture that
"the number of available channels cannot exceed the number of modes of a waveguide
with a cross-section given by the transverse aperture and made from the largest refractive
index used in the design"
This approach [649] has given suggested minimum thicknesses for differentiators [700], space
plates [639], and imagers; optimized designs are thicker than these limits by no more than a
factor of 3. It also gives limits for thickness of optical neural networks [704,705]; helps suggest
better designs for optical processing networks [705]; is consistent with subsequent more specific
limits for metalenses [706], metalens system design [707], and space plates in the microwave

an imager can actually increase the required thickness. Now all 𝑁pixels or channels

region [708]; and will impose thickness limits on metastructures for aberration correction [644].
Note the following about the overlapping nonlocality 𝐶.
1) 𝐶is not related to the physical size of the function being performed; a small camera and a
large camera with the same number of image pixels have the same overlapping nonlocality.
2) 𝐶is an effective mathematical dimensionality of our desired input-output relation, and in
that sense is independent of how we implement the device physically. In optics we may use
propagating modes in dielectric structures to carry these transverse channels, but the same
number of channels is required for any other physical implementation, such as plasmonics
or even electrical wires in radio-frequency systems (e.g., in "reflective intelligent surfaces"
with non-diagonal reflection coefficients [709]).
This concept of overlapping nonlocality is a quite general property of any optical or wave device
intended to implement some relation between inputs and outputs. Understanding and using this
concept can arguably help us design and operate all such systems.
Challenges and opportunities
Though the overlapping nonlocality 𝐶is well defined just from what we want the optical or wave
system to do, there are at least two challenges in using this approach to deduce the necessary
thickness of the required system.
1) We need to understand whether our approach to building the system can perform "di-
mensional interleaving" [649]. If we think of our system as having its input degrees of
freedom in two dimensions – 𝑥and 𝑦in Fig. 47(a) – we need to know if we can move
those degrees of freedom between the 𝑥and 𝑦dimensions. Now, a photonic integrated
circuit with a two-dimensional array of grating couplers can readily couple their outputs
to a one-dimensional array of waveguides, for example, hence "interleaving" the input
information from 𝑥and 𝑦degrees of freedom into a line in the 𝑦direction [649]. Many
 
Fig. 48. Illustration of the matrix multiplication 𝝓= 𝐷𝝍that represents the operation of
the device from inputs 𝝍to outputs 𝝓. The choice of the transverse aperture position on
the input surface divides the matrix into "left" and "right" parts, which also correspond
to the input positions to the left and the right of the transverse aperture position. The
choice of the transverse aperture position on the output surface divides the matrix
into "upper" and "lower" parts, which correspond to the left and right parts of the
output surface (relative to the transverse aperture position). These divisions generate
matrix quadrants 𝐷LR and 𝐷RL. The singular value decomposition of these quadrants
effectively defines numbers 𝐶LR and 𝐶RL of channels that are required to pass through
the transverse aperture in the operation of the device. The overlapping nonlocality is
then 𝐶= 𝐶LR + 𝐶RL.
143


===== PAGE 144 =====
other optical systems do not, however, do this interleaving; conventional imagers and lens
optics, free-space propagation, dielectric stacks, and photonic crystals all preserve the
degrees of freedom in each of the 𝑥and 𝑦directions [649]. If there is no dimensional
interleaving, the required thickness is determined by the number of degrees of freedom in
the 𝑥or 𝑦directions (whichever is larger) and on a one-dimensional version of channel
counting in a waveguide, which generally will lead to a larger thickness than if we can
perform dimensional interleaving.
We can form a "dimensional interleaving" conjecture here that
"dimensional interleaving is not possible without segmenting the field or, equivalently, it
requires a discontinuous mapping between input and output fields."
This conjecture remains to be proved or disproved. Note, for example, that a hypothetical array
of grating couplers segments the input optical field, essentially discontinuously. Another device
that could do dimensional interleaving, a photonic lantern [710], also segments the field as the
fused fibers at one end separate into discrete fibers at the other. This author knows of no way of
performing such dimensional interleaving without segmenting the field somewhere; of course,
this author’s possible ignorance proves nothing.
2) Using the overlapping nonlocality 𝐶to deduce minimum thickness of an optical system
that we have not yet designed has required the "maximum number of modes" conjecture
stated above. This conjecture also remains to be proved or disproved.
One possible approach to the "maximum number of modes" conjecture could be to use a multiple
scattering theorem [711] that relates dielectric constant contrast in a volume to achievable optical
functions; this has been used successfully for limits in one-dimensional structures [711,712],
though it has not so far been extended to two or three dimensions.
A limitation of this approach so far is that it is only analyzed for one frequency. Since different
frequencies are anyway orthogonal functions in that they can separately propagate through the
same channel, each containing different information (e.g., amplitudes), this approach has nothing
to say about additional limits or opportunities [713] in multi-frequency systems, and further such
additional limits remain open questions.
Future developments to address challenges
Clear future directions for understanding and applying overlapping nonlocality are to prove or
disprove the "maximum number of modes" and "dimensional interleaving" conjectures stated
above. These conjectures are, of course, interesting for their direct relevance to overlapping
nonlocality. Possibly, however, proving or disproving them might require moving beyond our
typical ideas for understanding waves; as such, addressing them might expose new areas of
opportunity. A final comment on future directions is that this overlapping nonlocality work
emphasizes the importance of analyzing nonlocality also in real space, not just in the 𝑘-space
"plane-wave basis" approach. Such plane waves are, of course, mathematically completely
nonlocal because they have infinite lateral extent. This approach has been powerful and successful
in many ways. It is, however, quite awkward mathematically in a 𝑘-space approach to introduce
a surface that divides real space into two parts. Possibly as a result, overlapping nonlocality,
though implicit in any actual design based on 𝑘-space approaches, may be far from obvious
in that description. Such plane-wave approaches are also generally problematic as we move
to small structures – e.g., from several wavelengths to sub-wavelength sizes – where they are
arguably not a good basis and can cause us to miss physics in the problem. For small structures,
physically there are really no (plane) evanescent waves, for example [703]. To model waves in
144


===== PAGE 145 =====
and out of such structures, spherical waves [703,714] are a better fundamental basis. Unlike
plane waves, such spherical waves are countable, which can help in counting channels, and by
using "bounding spheres" they can implicitly include the finite size of real objects [703,714].
These results remind us of the importance of thinking also in real space when analyzing wave
systems and generally of being prepared to move beyond 𝑘-space descriptions.
Concluding remarks
The idea of overlapping nonlocality is ultimately a simple one that we can deduce directly from
what we want our optical system to do. Using it to predict requirements and limits in optical
designs of various kinds looks to be a potential productive and useful direction. At the same
time, it is exposing new conjectures and ways of thinking about wave devices that may test and
expand our understanding and use of waves in general.

Conclusion and outlook
FRANCESCO MONTICONE
& N. ASGER MORTENSEN
Assembling this roadmap has given us a unique opportunity to work with many of the leading
experts in this field to explore the rapidly expanding landscape of nonlocal responses in natural
and artificial materials. Through more than thirty sections, this roadmap highlights an impressive
array of exciting new developments and emerging directions. It is clear that the multifaceted
concept of nonlocality is playing an increasingly important role in optical materials science and
technology, from advancing our understanding of anomalous and extreme forms of light-matter
interactions and revealing new insights into the fundamental limits of wave physics, to unlocking
new opportunities for optical devices based on nonlocality engineering. In the spirit of this
roadmap, we believe that future progress in this field will not be "local" but will depend on an
extended range of contributions from multiple areas. We hope that this roadmap, bringing together
insights from different corners of this field, serves as a valuable guide to the current landscape
of nonlocality in photonic materials and metamaterials and will inspire further innovation in
expanding its frontier.
