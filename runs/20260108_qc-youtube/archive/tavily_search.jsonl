This quantum mechanical property unlocks exponential performance gains for certain types of algorithms and simulations. \n\nHowever, realizing the full potential of quantum computing remains an immense technical challenge. Current quantum systems are highly fragile, requiring precise control and error correction techniques to maintain the quantum states necessary for computation.

The result isn’t incremental progress — it’s an acceleration of intelligence itself.\n\nQuantum computing and AI are the twin engines of the 21st century. Alone, each is transformative.

Quantum computers operate in probabilities — a blur of “maybes” that collapses only when measured.\n\nThis shift mirrors how the human brain functions. We don’t process decisions as absolutes but as evolving probabilities refined by context.\n\nIn this sense, quantum computing doesn’t just speed up AI — it humanizes it, pushing machines closer to the nonlinear, intuitive nature of human cognition.\n\n## Quantum Data: The Next Fuel of Intelligence [...] ## The Synergy of Quantum and Artificial Intelligence\n\nAt its core, AI thrives on pattern recognition, optimization, and massive computation. Quantum computing, meanwhile, thrives on superposition and entanglement — the ability to process countless states simultaneously.\n\nWhen combined, these paradigms can tackle problems once considered computationally impossible:\n\n Modeling molecular behavior at atomic precision\n Predicting market dynamics across infinite variables\n Accelerating neural network training exponentially\n\nThe partnership isn’t symbolic; it’s structural. Quantum amplifies what AI can compute, while AI helps quantum systems stabilize, predict errors, and evolve.\n\n## A Brief Look Back: From Physics to Cognition\n\nThe roots of this convergence trace back decades.

These machines will allow us to move beyond purely experimental NISQ quantum algorithms, unlocking practical and potentially unexpected advantages for AI applications.\n\nJust as AI research exploded once high-performance computing became widely available, we anticipate that Quantum AI will experience a similar inflection point as scalable, fault-tolerant quantum hardware becomes reality.” Dr Ines de Vega, Head of Quantum Innovation at IQM, summarizes.\n\nThe fusion of Quantum Computing and AI has the potential for a massive impact on the world. Quantum and AI together could solve problems that classical computers cannot, making AI more efficient, faster, and more powerful. While we’re still in the early stages, the progress in both fields suggests that this is more than just a theoretical concept. [...] In fault-tolerant quantum computing, extra qubits are used to protect information and correct errors. This process relies on decoders, software that identifies and fixes mistakes. The most precise decoders today are AI-powered, and we plan to develop them for our fault-tolerant IQM quantum computers.\n\nOptimizing Quantum Algorithms with AI\n\nRunning useful quantum applications requires optimizing how quantum operations are mapped onto the hardware. AI can help by designing smarter transpilers, software that efficiently translates industrial-use quantum algorithms into operations that work best on IQM’s quantum computers. This will make quantum computing faster and more practical for real-world applications.\n\nAI for Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM)\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in quantum computing today is dealing with noise, which causes errors in calculations. Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) helps reduce this noise, but existing methods are slow and require running many extra circuits, making them impractical for large-scale use. [...] Here’s how:\n\n1.   Faster training of AI models: Quantum computers can perform complex matrix operations faster than classical systems, speeding up deep learning training.\n2.   Enhanced optimization: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) could improve AI optimization tasks, such as fine-tuning machine learning models.\n3.

One future strategy is the use of AI to generate novel quantum algorithms. Such a process could begin by defining a scientific problem and then working backward to generate the quantum circuits needed to provide a solution according to some figure of merit. Optimistically, one could hope that beyond an application-specific algorithm, such an approach might also lead researchers to entirely new algorithmic primitives and thus unlock whole new classes of quantum algorithms.

By leveraging quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference, these models offer the potential for significant reductions in both computational cost and energy consumption. With fewer parameters required, quantum models could make AI more sustainable, tackling one of the biggest challenges facing the industry today.\n\nThe work being done by Quantinuum reflects the start of the next chapter in AI, and one that is transformative. As quantum computing matures, its integration with AI has the potential to unlock entirely new approaches that are not only more efficient and performant but can also handle the full complexities of natural language. The fact that Quantinuum’s quantum computers are the most advanced in the world, and cannot be simulated classically, gives us a unique glimpse into a future. [...] ##### Looking to the Future\n\nIn this initial proof-of-concept collaborative study between Quantinuum and Hiverge, we demonstrate that AI-driven algorithm discovery can generate efficient quantum heuristics. Specifically, we found a great reduction in quantum resources, which is impactful for quantum algorithmic primitives that are frequently reused. Importantly, this approach is highly flexible; it can accommodate the optimisation of any desired quantum resource, from circuit evaluations to the number of operations in a given circuit. This work opens a path toward fully automated pipelines capable of developing problem-specific quantum algorithms optimised for NISQ as well as future hardware.\n\nAn important question for further investigation regards transferability and generalisation of a discovered quantum solution to other molecules, going beyond the generalisation over bond lengths of the same molecule that we have already observed. Evidently, this approach can be applied to improving any other near-term quantum algorithm for a range of applications from optimisation to quantum simulation.

Cooling power is a measure of how much heat a device can remove in a certain amount of time, and drops exponentially as temperatures approach absolute zero. Conventional control electronics dissipate far too much heat to be integrated inside these fridges. So instead, quantum computers normally rely on racks of external hardware connected to the qubits via bulky cabling that can also introduce considerable amounts heat into the fridge.\n\nThis is an inefficient use of both space and cooling budgets, and significantly restricts the number of qubits that can be squeezed into each fridge. Now though, startups are developing electronics, amplifiers and cabling specially designed for these challenging cryogenic environment.

That’s the message coming from a small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the emerging quantum computing industry. [...] Harbach’s group has been investigating the relevance of quantum computing to Merck’s work for about six years. While NISQ devices may potentially have uses for some certain highly specialized problems, they’ve concluded that quantum computing will not have a significant impact on industry until fault-tolerance is achieved. Even then, how transformative that impact could be really depends on the specific use case and products a company is working on, says Harbach.\n\nQuantum computers shine at providing accurate solutions to problems that become intractable at larger scales for classical computers. That could be very useful for some applications, such as designing new catalysts, says Harbach. But most of the chemistry problems Merck is interested in involve screening large numbers of candidate molecules very quickly.\n\n“Most problems in quantum chemistry do not scale exponentially, and approximations are sufficient,” he says. “They are well behaved problems, you just need to make them faster with increased system size.” [...] IEEE.orgIEEE Xplore Digital LibraryIEEE StandardsMore Sites\n\nSign InJoin IEEE\n\nThe January issue of IEEE Spectrum is here!\n\nDownload PDF ↓\n\n Close bar;)\n\nQuantum Computing’s Hard, Cold Reality Check\n\nShare\n\nFOR THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDER\n\nExplore by topic\n\nAerospaceAIBiomedicalClimate TechComputingConsumer ElectronicsEnergyHistory of TechnologyRoboticsSemiconductorsTelecommunicationsTransportation\n\nIEEE Spectrum\n\nFOR THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDER\n\n### Topics\n\nAerospaceAIBiomedicalClimate TechComputingConsumer ElectronicsEnergyHistory of TechnologyRoboticsSemiconductorsTelecommunicationsTransportation\n\n### Sections\n\nFeaturesNewsOpinionCareersDIYEngineering Resources\n\n### More\n\nNewslettersSpecial ReportsCollectionsExplainersTop Programming LanguagesRobots Guide ↗IEEE Job Site ↗\n\n### For IEEE Members\n\nCurrent IssueMagazine ArchiveThe InstituteThe Institute Archive\n\n### For IEEE Members\n\nCurrent IssueMagazine ArchiveThe InstituteThe Institute Archive", "score": 0.70799106, "raw_content": null, "summary": "CREATE AN ACCOUNTSIGN IN ComputingSemiconductorsNews # Quantum Computing’s Hard, Cold Reality Check Hype is everywhere, skeptics say, and practical applications are still far away Edd Gent 22 Dec 2023 6 min read Edd Gent is a contributing editor for IEEE Spectrum.
