Host Graeme Scott is joined by AI architect and data science leader Sumitro Ghatak to unpack why most AI proof-of-concepts fail, the hidden risks of rushing agentic and generative AI into production, and why trust, governance, cost, and energy usage matter as much as capability. The conversation spans AI singularity, hallucinations, enterprise risk, ROI, foundational machine-learning knowledge, and the need for a new AI leadership function inside organisations - ultimately reframing AI not as a replacement for people, but as augmented intelligence that drives sustainable growth.\n\nSumitro Ghatak is a Lead Data Scientist and AI Architect for IBM, with over a decade of experience designing and deploying large-scale AI systems across global enterprises. With deep expertise spanning traditional machine learning, generative AI, and agentic systems, Sumitro has worked across industries in Europe, Asia, and the United States, helping organisations move AI from proof-of-concept into real-world production.\n\nAn IEEE Senior Member and active reviewer for international research conferences, Sumitro also contributes to intellectual property development and AI governance initiatives. His work focuses on building responsible, scalable AI systems that balance innovation with trust, security, and long-term business value - making him a leading voice on how organisations should adopt AI without falling victim to hype.\n\nThe GAEA Talks podcast series to brought to you by GAEA AI https://gaealgm.ai", "channel_title": "GAEA AI", "channel_id": "UCNE6htHTePRhJMmNueDIxLw", "published_at": "2025-12-29T00:00:15Z", "duration": "PT1H11M23S", "tags": ["AI", "GAEA AI", "GAEA Talks", "LGM", "LLM", "Artificial Intelligence", "agentic AI", "generative AI", "enterprise AI", "AI governance", "AI risk", "AI strategy", "AI leadership", "AI ROI", "machine learning", "data science", "AI architecture", "business AI", "AI transformation", "future of AI", "AI ethics", "AI productivity", "AI in enterprise", "technology leadership", "AI podcast", "Talking AI", "Graeme Scott", "AI innovation"], "view_count": "107432", "like_count": "144", "comment_count": null, "search_rank": 3, "source": "search", "summary": "Host Graeme Scott is joined by AI architect and data science leader Sumitro Ghatak to unpack why most AI proof-of-concepts fail, the hidden risks of rushing agentic and generative AI into production, and why trust, governance, cost, and energy usage matter as much as capability.
