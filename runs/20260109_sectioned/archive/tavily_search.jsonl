Nvidia’s Jensen Huang calls this the age of physical AI. Humanoid robots will transition from demonstrations to targeted commercial pilots in warehouses and factories (with leaders like Tesla, Figure and Agility aiming for thousands to tens of thousands of units), augmenting workers in controlled environments while proving safety and ROI.\n\nBeyond factories, 2026 will see AI accelerate scientific and healthcare discovery, designing experiments, predicting outcomes and co-authoring breakthroughs in drug development and materials science.\n\n4. Multi-Agent Orchestration Becomes the Enterprise Breakthrough\n\nIn 2026, single agents will evolve into orchestrated multi-agent systems something like dozens or hundreds of specialized agents collaborating on complex, long-running tasks like supply chain optimization, R&D pipelines or patient care journeys. Forrester warns of a major agentic breach without proper orchestration. [...] 3. Physical AI Pilots Transform Manufacturing and Beyond\n\nSkilled labor shortages have become structural. Pipe fitters, technicians and experienced operators are in short supply worldwide. In 2026, manufacturers will turn to AI not just to save costs but to survive.\n\nAI will augment skilled workers by automating repetitive tasks, improving safety outcomes, optimizing supply chains and personalizing training at scale. Companies that embrace AI-driven productivity will dominate production and cost efficiency. Those that do not will fall behind quickly.\n\nWhile many industries struggle to quantify AI returns, manufacturing offers controlled environments where results can be proven with complex numbers. Defect rates will drop, production will increase and cycle times will shrink. The industry will shift from pilots and experimentation to enterprise-wide, real-world production. [...] 5. Agentic AI Runs Logistics and Production\n\nIn 2026, agentic AI will manage logistics and production end-to-end. AI agents will reroute inventory in real time, expedite shipments, allocate maintenance resources and dynamically adjust manufacturing based on need. Businesses that adopt agentic systems early will gain structural operational advantages over competitors.\n\n6. Amazon Reemerges as an AI Infrastructure Leader\n\nAfter a period of relative underperformance, Amazon will reassert itself in 2026 as AWS reaccelerates. Compute bottlenecks will fade, Trainium chips will see real enterprise adoption and AWS growth will reaccelerate to high-teens or low-20s percentages, driven by Trainium adoption and easing capacity constraints.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, AI infrastructure spending continues toward a projected $7 trillion value. Amazon’s integrated cloud, compute and tooling ecosystem will position it as a central beneficiary of the next phase of AI adoption.", "score": 0.90869105, "raw_content": null, "summary": "Humanoid robots will transition from demonstrations to targeted commercial pilots in warehouses and factories (with leaders like Tesla, Figure and Agility aiming for thousands to tens of thousands of units), augmenting workers in controlled environments while proving safety and ROI.

Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like the Ray-Ban Meta are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like AI-powered health rings and smartwatches are normalizing always-on, on-body inference.

OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to theLinux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation, which aims to help standardize open source agentic tools. Google also has begun standing up its own managed MCP servers to connect AI agents to its products and services.\n\nWith MCP reducing the friction of connecting agents to real systems, 2026 is likely to be the year agentic workflows finally move from demos into day-to-day practice.\n\nRajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, says these advancements will lead to agent-first solutions taking on “system-of-record roles” across industries.", "score": 0.8978479, "raw_content": null, "summary": "Smart glasses like the Ray-Ban Meta are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like AI-powered health rings and smartwatches are normalizing always-on, on-body inference.

If you’re new to agentic AI or want to strengthen your fundamentals, we recommend reviewing these articles first. They establish the common language and core concepts that the following trends build upon. Think of them as prerequisite courses before advancing to the cutting edge of what’s emerging in 2026.\n\n## Seven Emerging Trends Defining 2026\n\n### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration: The “Microservices Moment” for AI\n\nThe agentic AI field is going through its microservices revolution. Just as monolithic applications gave way to distributed service architectures, single all-purpose agents are being replaced by orchestrated teams of specialized agents. Gartner reported a staggering 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025, signaling a shift in how systems are designed. [...] ## Navigating the Agentic Transition\n\nThe trends shaping 2026 represent more than incremental improvements. They signal a restructuring of how we build, deploy, and govern AI systems. The organizations that will thrive are those that recognize agentic AI isn’t about smarter automation. It’s about new architectures (multi-agent orchestration), new standards (MCP/A2A protocols), new economics (FinOps for agents), and new organizational capabilities (governance maturity, workflow redesign).\n\nFor machine learning practitioners, the path forward is clear:\n\n Learn the foundational patterns and memory architectures covered in Machine Learning Mastery’s existing guides\n Develop expertise in the emerging trends outlined here\n Start with single-agent systems using proven design patterns\n Add complexity only when simpler approaches fail\n Invest in governance and cost optimization from day one\n Design for human-agent collaboration rather than full automation [...] ### Navigation\n\nMaking developers awesome at machine learning\n\nMaking developers awesome at machine learning\n\nClick to Take the FREE Crash-Course\n\n# 7 Agentic AI Trends to Watch in 2026\n\nBy Vinod Chugani on January 5, 2026 in Artificial Intelligence  0\n\n7 Agentic AI Trends to Watch in 2026  \nImage by Author\n\nThe agentic AI field is moving from experimental prototypes to production-ready autonomous systems. Industry analysts project the market will surge from $7.8 billion today to over \\$52 billion by 2030, while Gartner predicts that 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025.

M42’s AIRIS-TB is a screening tool designed to automate reporting of normal chest X-rays in large-scale TB screening programs, addressing the redundancy inherent to low-prevalence workflows. This talk will outline the model’s development, calibration to achieve near-zero TB false-negative rates, and integration across screening centers. Beyond technical details, it will share lessons in addressing data imbalance, selecting clinically meaningful metrics, navigating regulatory uncertainties, building clinician trust, and driving adoption, offering a grounded view of what responsible, real-world AI deployment in healthcare looks like.

So that's that's how we try to make sure that there we don't miss out any of these TB or even non-TB specific uh findings through that audit trail. another way we you know make sure um I mean I guess in the end it all comes down to auditing the system. >> That's good. I think that's all the questions. Thank you very much for the exciting talk.
