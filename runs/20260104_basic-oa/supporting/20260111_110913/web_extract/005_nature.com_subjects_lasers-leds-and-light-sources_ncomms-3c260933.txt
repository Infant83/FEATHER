### [Reconfigurable all-solid-state topological lasing at arbitrary sites](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68173-7)

Topological lasers usually emit light from a fixed spot. Here, authors report on an all-solid-state platform where topological lasing is demonstrated at trivial lattice terminations as well as at reconfigurable arbitrary sites. The device consists of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array, printed in a disordered Nd:BaLaGa₃O₇ crystal.

### [Ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core excitons in graphite: a femtosecond RIXS perspective](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67919-7)

Core excitons are strongly localised excitonic states impacting x-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) spectra. Here, the authors demonstrate an application of free electron laser-driven ultrafast RIXS spectroscopy to study previously unclear aspects of core exciton-phonon interactions in graphite.

### [Highly coherent organic lasing based on etch-free metasurface](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67628-1)

Etch-free metasurfaces supporting bound states in the continuum have been used for lasing, although only as passive devices. Here, authors demonstrate highly coherent lasing from an active etch-free metasurface, showing a divergence angle of 0.2⁰, a linewidth of 0.04 nm and coherence time of 20.4 ps.

### [Deuteration promotes circularly polarized light emission by suppression of vibration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67342-y)

Circularly polarized light emitters face a trade-off between dissymmetry factor and quantum yield. Here, authors deuterate chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, achieving over 2-fold increase in electroluminescence dissymmetry factor and device efficiency close to 40%.

Photonic time crystals provide a time equivalent to standard spatial crystals. Here, authors observe wave amplification induced by the time modulation and provide experimental proof of a nontrivial temporal topology in the middle of a momentum bandgap.

### [Excited state reversal in copper iodide clusters enables 100% exciton radiation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67664-x)

Intra-ligand charge transfer (LCT) in Cu4I4 cubes is effectively strengthened to make LCT featured excited states reversely lower than cluster-centered quenching states, resulting in electroluminescent external quantum efficiency beyond 35% and record-high 100% exciton radiation.

He et al. report a lanthanide-doping strategy for dual-halogen-alloyed perovskite microplates, which promotes phase segregation and facilitates ion migration in the alloyed case, while suppressing it in the phase-segregated state, resulting in dual-wavelength lasing in visible spectral region.

Reliability remains challenging for organic light-emitting diodes used in solid-state lighting. Here, the authors reduce the current density needed for a given brightness by fabricating devices on a high aspect ratio substrate with sub-mm texture, resulting in a 2.7x increase in operating lifetime.

The tunability of the polarization state of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on conventional semiconductors is usually limited. Here, the authors report the realization of mid-infrared LEDs based on a Weyl semiconductor, layered Te, showing the electrical tunability of the degree of linear polarization of the emitted light from ~100% to 36%.
