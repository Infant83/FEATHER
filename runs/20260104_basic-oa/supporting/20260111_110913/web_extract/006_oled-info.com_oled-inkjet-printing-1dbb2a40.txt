# OLED ink jet printing: introduction and market status

*Last updated on Sun 23/11/2025 - 16:56*

OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) is a flat light emitting technology, made by placing a series of organic thin films (usually carbon based) between two conductors. When an electrical current is applied, light is emitted. OLEDs are used to make displays and lighting panels. OLEDs today are widely used in TVs, smartphones, tablets, laptops and wearables.

While OLED displays excel in color-contrast and efficiency compared to LCDs, they’ve also proven relatively hard to produce on a large scale. A potential technology that could reduce OLED production costs is inkjet printing.

## OLED inkjet printing

Current OLED production relies on evaporation processes, in which the organic materials are deposited onto a glass sheet through a thin metal stencil, also known as a "shadow mask" or FMM (Fine Metal Mask). This process is problematic, as a significant amount of the material is wasted because it disperses all over the mask, in addition to inherent mask changes which expose the sheet to dust and compromise yields (OLEDs are by nature sensitive to contamination).

Inkjet OLED printing has the desirable ability to allow precision deposition without the use of a mask. It also produces less stray particles, thus boosting yields. These significant advantages make this technology interesting to many OLED developers. Printing OLEDs, though, is a challenging task - in terms of production process viability, drying the materials, production time, and the soluble OLED materials which are [less effective than evaporable ones](https://www.oled-info.com/udcs-evaporable-emitters-still-outperform-best-soluble-materials). It is also challenging for inkjet printing to reach high densities, and in the past it was believed that inkjet printing is only suitable for TV production. In recent years, though there's been much improvement and now we are seeing higher density prototypes (laptop displays, for example).

## Printed OLEDs in 2025

Inkjet printing is adopted in OLED production today in two areas. One is the encapsulation layer deposition - [almost all OLEDs that adopt TFE encapsulation use inkjet printing to deposit the organic elements](https://www.oled-info.com/oled-encapsulation). Inkjet printing is also used to deposit the quantum dots in [Samsung's QD-OLED production process](https://www.oled-info.com/qd-oled).

The most interesting use case for inkjet printing, though, is in the deposition of the OLED stack materials (emitters and other layers). In 2025, China's TCL CSOT [started mass producing inkjet printed OLED](https://www.oled-info.com/tcl-starts-mass-producing-inkjet-printed-oleds-216-4k-oled-monitor-panel-first)s in its 5.5-Gen line, and has also [started building a large-volume 8.6-Gen inkjet printing line](https://www.oled-info.com/tcl-csot-build-4-billion-86-gen-inkjet-printing-it-oled-production-line).

We covered the [latest status of OLED Inkjet Printing in an article in July 2025](https://www.oled-info.com/will-oled-inkjet-printing-finally-take-2025-premium-article).

Inkjet printing can also be used to deposit OLED materials for OLED lighting panels, which is an easier task compared to display production. In March 2024 Germany-based OLED lighting developer Inuru [inaugurated its new OLED lighting inkjet printing production line](https://www.oled-info.com/inuru-inaugerates-its-inkjet-printing-oled-lighting-production-line-wildau), the "Dragon Factory", in Wildau near Berlin, Germany.

## [Counterpoint details the capex needs of FMM, photo patterned and inkjet OLED lines](/counterpoint-details-capex-needs-fmm-photo-patterned-and-inkjet-oled-lines)

Counterpoint (DSCC) released an interesting post, detailing the display industry's capex spending in the near future. Unsurprisingly, OLED technology will contribute the majority share of these investments.

After a long time during which all OLED production was performed using FMM (evaporation and mask) technology, finally we are seeing two competing technologies - photo patterned OLEDs (adopting by Visionox as ViP and JDI as eLEAP), and inkjet printing (adopted by TCL CSoT). According to counterpoint, the price different between FMM and Photo-Patterned, in terms of the investment in equipment, is not dramatic. In fact, the company estimates that it is 8% cheaper to build a photo-patterned production line. Counterpoint admits, though, that it may be a bit early to understand the complete costs involved with such a line.

## [Will OLED inkjet printing finally take off in 2025? We explore the past, present and future of OLED inkjet technology](/will-oled-inkjet-printing-finally-take-2025-premium-article)

Inkjet printing of OLED displays has been in development for many years, driven by the potential of this deposition technology to reduce the cost of OLED display manufacturing.

Currently, the vast majority of AMOLED, WOLED, and QD-OLED production relies on evaporation methods to deposit OLED layers. In these processes, OLED molecules are evaporated and then deposited onto the required substrates. For AMOLED displays, precise subpixel patterning is necessary, which requires the use of a fine metal mask (FMM). While subpixel patterning is less complex for WOLED and QD-OLED production, these technologies still depend on material evaporation.

Evaporation-based OLED deposition has enabled the large-scale production of high-quality, affordable OLED displays found in wearables, smartphones, tablets, laptops, monitors, and TVs. This approach forms the foundation of today’s OLED industry, which exceeds $40 billion in value.

This article will examine the alternative approach of OLED inkjet printing, review its history and current status, and consider its future prospects.
