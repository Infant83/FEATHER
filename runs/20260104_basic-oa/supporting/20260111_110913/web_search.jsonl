Results Figure 1 illustrates the concept. Relative to a standard planar device, the same OLED layer stack on a triangular corrugated substrate with height-to-width aspect ratio, 𝜁= ℎ/𝑤, has a larger active OLED area (𝐴dev) per unit panel area (𝐴pan) by a factor of 𝛽AE ≡𝐴dev/𝐴pan = √1 + (2𝜁)2 .

Defining the outcoupling enhancement factor, 𝛽oc, as the ratio of the high aspect device EQE to the planar control yields 𝛽oc ≈1.6 and 𝛽oc ≈1.4 for the AE1.1 and AE1.4 devices, respectively (Fig. 6a, right-hand axis). These enhancement factors are consistent with ray tracing simulations described in Supplementary Note 2.

The framework is comprised of dual steps: (i) OLED stack design to maximize the radiant power delivery (\\({\\eta }\\_{{{{\\rm{IAPD}}}}}\\)) between emitting and receiving apertures (EA and RA) and (ii) low-profile LOS design to maximize the outcoupling to air with a given preference to specific angular distribution (e.g., center-focused or widely distributed, etc.) The former was done by defining the ATW function between the EA of a source and the RA of a light outcoupling structure (LOS), both of which have finite lateral dimensions. The overlap integral (\\({\\gamma }\\_{{{{\\rm{ATW}}}}}\\)) of ATW and intensity [...] The stratified structure of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) confines much of the generated light within substrates or organic layers, limiting outcoupling to air. Macroscale half-ball lenses extract most substrate-trapped light but compromise the inherent planarity of OLEDs, while microlens arrays (MLAs), only tens of micrometres tall, preserve planarity yet provide only modest enhancements, particularly with limited lateral dimensions. Here, we introduce a systematic strategy to enhance outcoupling while maintaining near-planarity. By jointly tailoring the OLED device stack and the topography of near-planar outcoupling structures, we overcome the limited prompt extraction responsible for the modest performance of conventional MLAs.

One is the encapsulation layer deposition - almost all OLEDs that adopt TFE encapsulation use inkjet printing to deposit the organic elements. Inkjet printing is also used to deposit the quantum dots in Samsung's QD-OLED production process.\n\nLG 32EP950 OLED monitor (31\" 4K printed OLED panel by JOLED)\n\nThe most interesting use case for inkjet printing, though, is in the deposition of the OLED stack materials (emitters and other layers). In 2025, China's TCL CSOT started mass producing inkjet printed OLEDs in its 5.5-Gen line, and has also started building a large-volume 8.6-Gen inkjet printing line.\n\nWe covered the latest status of OLED Inkjet Printing in an article in July 2025. [...] Inkjet printing can also be used to deposit OLED materials for OLED lighting panels, which is an easier task compared to display production.

We since then heard conflicting reports - that TCL decided to delay its plans, or that it has changed its focus to smartphone type displays.\n\nNo we hear that the company has managed to increase the performance of its inkjet printing process, and has managed to achieve a display density of 350 PPI - up from around 325PPI.

TADF materials enable efficient light emission without relying on heavy metals such as platinum or iridium. However, low-cost manufacturing of large-scale TADF OLEDs has been restricted due to their incompatibility with solution processing techniques. In this study, we develop ink formulation for a TADF material and show successful ink jet printing of intricate patterns over a large area (6400 mm2) without the use of any lithography. The stable ink is successfully achieved using a non-chlorinated binary solvent mixture for a solution processable TADF material,", "score": 0.6729558, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adom.202502807", "title": "Research Progress on the Preparation of OLED Based on the Inkjet ...", "content": "In this review, the critical parameters governing ink formulation are delineated and provide an overview of prevailing OLED device architectures", "score": 0.5530473, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/13/3175", "title": "Thin-Film Encapsulation for OLEDs and Its Advances - MDPI", "content": "The current flexible encapsulation solutions used in commercial manufacturing are typically inorganic/organic/inorganic stacked-layer encapsulation, in which the inorganic layer mainly refers to inorganic films of silicon nitride (SiNx) and silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology, which have a high water vapor/oxygen barrier property and the thickness is generally greater than 1000 nm . The organic layer mainly refers to transparent polymer films prepared by inkjet printing (IJP) technology, which have excellent defect coverage and stress buffer performance, and the thickness is generally set to 8~15 μm.

However, the organic buffer layer must also fulfill the function of covering the particles, which necessitates a compromise between the passivation capability of particles and mechanical reliability. The current commercial manufacturing process employs inkjet printing equipment with piezoelectric printheads to achieve the coating and patterning of the organic buffer layer. It is challenging for this type of inkjet equipment to form a layer with a thickness of less than 2 μm without the formation of the MURA effect in the organic buffer layer.
