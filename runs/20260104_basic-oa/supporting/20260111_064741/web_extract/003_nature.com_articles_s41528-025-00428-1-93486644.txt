## Abstract

Driven by innovations in the form factor of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, the application scope of OLED technology now encompasses the biomedical field, in addition to its existing application domains of mobile phones, televisions, and lighting. This paper introduces an ultrathin, ultraflexible, and high-power bio-OLED patch with perfect waterproofing and an elongation of 2.04% through material and structural design. Furthermore, the OLED patch with a parallel-stacked OLED delivers a high output of 100 mW/cm2, achieves a 40% power density improvement compared to glass-based OLEDs using optimized encapsulation, and is suitable for photodynamic therapy owing to its lifetime of 183 h at an intensity of 35 mW/cm2. Since OLED patches are required for long-term stable operation in various biomedical applications, we developed an OLED patch with an outcoupling structure using a simple method. The improved OLED patch achieved a 35% increase in light extraction compared to the original OLED patch.

## Introduction

Advances in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are driven by their advantageous characteristics, such as providing self-luminous lighting, serving as surface light sources, low weights, low thicknesses, and excellent mechanical flexibility, which have led to the emergence of flexible-display technologies[1](#ref-CR1 "Keum, C. et al.

High-performance hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes exploiting blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent dyes. Dyes Pigments 147, 83–89 (2017)."). The recent development of high-performance encapsulation barriers and high-efficiency OLEDs has spurred research on free-form displays, such as foldable, wearable, and stretchable devices. With the advent of next-generation displays, the OLED technology, which has been pivotal in revolutionizing traditional household electronics such as smartphones, personal computers, and televisions, has been extended to biomedical systems[11](#ref-CR11 "Jeon, Y. et al. Sandwich-structure transferable free-form OLEDs for wearable and disposable skin wound photomedicine. Light Sci. Appl. 8, 114 (2019)."),[12](#ref-CR12 "Jeon, Y. et al.

                 (2025).").

The potential of OLEDs in the field of phototherapeutics has been reported. Jeon et al. realized transferable OLEDs using attachable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as wearable photobiomodulation (PBM) patches[13](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR13 "Jeon, Y. et al. A wearable photobiomodulation patch using a flexible red-wavelength OLED and its in vitro differential cell proliferation effects. Adv. Mater. Technol. 3, 1700391 (2018)."). The wearable PBM patch exhibited excellent wound healing effects, with fibroblast proliferation in over 58% of control and fibroblast migration in over 46% of control, providing evidence for its potential in epidermal healing. Choi et al. demonstrated the textile-based medical applications of blue OLEDs for neonatal jaundice[17](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR17 "Choi, S. et al. Wearable photomedicine for neonatal jaundice treatment using blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs): Toward textile-based wearable phototherapeutics. Adv. Sci. 9, 1–10 (2022)."). Textile-based blue OLEDs have demonstrated lower voltage operation compared to traditional blue LEDs, as well as human body-burn stability, excellent operational lifetime, and therapeutic efficacy. This study confirmed the potential application of OLEDs in treating neonatal jaundice. In addition, research on OLED-based biomedical applications is being conducted; however, previous research has shown that the mechanical and chemical stabilities of OLED systems are limited because of the lack of in-depth consideration of the material and structural design, and complex planarization processes for very rough wearable textiles are required. The surface of an OLED system attached to the human body is not composed of biocompatible materials, which may cause adverse effects.

Thin-film encapsulation (TFE), achieved by alternately stacking inorganic and organic films, is a key technology for implementing highly reliable free-form displays[18](#ref-CR18 "Seo, S.-W., Chae, H., Joon Seo, S., Kyoon Chung, H. & Min Cho, S. Extremely bendable thin-film encapsulation of organic light-emitting diodes. Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 161908 (2013)."),[19](#ref-CR19 "Kang, K. S., Jeong, S. Y., Jeong, E. G. & Choi, K. C.

Highly reliable and ultra-flexible wearable OLEDs enabled by environmentally and mechanically robust hybrid multibarrier encapsulation layers. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2411802, 1–16 (2024)."). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows the fabrication of high-density, pinhole-free inorganic barriers and thin-film structures called nanolaminates. As these ALD-based inorganic barriers have a very low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), even with a thickness of several tens of nanometers, they have contributed significantly to improving the lifetime of organic devices[28](#ref-CR28 "Park, S.-H. K. et al. Ultrathin film encapsulation of an OLED by ALD. Electrochem. Solid-State Lett. 8, H21 (2005)."),[29](#ref-CR29 "Hoffmann, L. et al.

Low-temperature fabrication of robust, transparent, and flexible thin film transistor with nano-laminated insulator. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 10, 15829–15840 (2018)."). However, previous inorganic barriers are highly vulnerable to mechanical stress, and their barrier properties easily degrade in hygrothermal environments[25](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR25 "Lee, S. et al.

Appl. Phys. 121, 025306 (2017)."). In addition, the ALD process at temperatures above 70 °C is difficult to use for some organic devices or causes residual stress within the entire structure, requiring a lower temperature ALD barrier process[34](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR34 "Jeon, Y. et al. Highly efficient and reliable organic light–emitting diodes enabled by a multifunctional hazy substrate for extreme environments. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2310268, 1–15 (2023)."). Therefore, improving the mechanical and environmental durability of low-temperature TFEs is important for developing highly reliable OLEDs. However, facile methods and systematic analyses of the material and structural design of organic/inorganic encapsulated multibarrier structures to improve key encapsulation properties have been rarely reported.

Among the various therapeutic patch platforms, optical-based devices have been developed for applications in the biomedical fields, offering the advantages of noninvasive and safe use[35](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR35 "Yun, S. H. & Kwok, S. J. J. Light in diagnosis, therapy and surgery. Nat. Biomed. Eng. 1, 0008 (2017)."). In particular, applications of flexible OLEDs are increasing in the biomedical field[36](/articles/s41528-025-00428-1#ref-CR36 "Cho, E. H. et al.
