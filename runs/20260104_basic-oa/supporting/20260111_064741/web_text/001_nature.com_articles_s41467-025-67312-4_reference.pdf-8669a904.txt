Abstract 
Reliability is particularly challenging for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) used in solid-state lighting 
applications because OLED lifetime is inversely proportional to luminance, and most lighting applications 
demand high luminance. Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this tradeoff by constructing OLEDs on 
a substrate with sub-mm, high aspect ratio surface texture. By creating more active OLED area per unit 
lighting panel area, the device current density required to generate a given panel luminance decreases. We 
validate this approach for fluorescent and phosphorescent OLEDs, demonstrating good thickness 
uniformity on corrugated substrates with area enhancement factors up to 1.4x using a standard thermal

evaporator. Relative to planar controls at the same panel current density, the high aspect ratio devices 
achieve a 2.7-fold increase in operating lifetime and up to a 40% increase in external light extraction 
efficiency, indicating that this approach offers a powerful pathway to improve the efficiency and lifetime 
of OLED lighting.

Introduction 
 
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are widely used in mobile displays and flat panel televisions1–3 but 
have yet to penetrate the general lighting market4. One challenge unique to OLED lighting stems from the 
fact that lighting applications require roughly an order of magnitude higher luminance than displays5. 
Because OLED efficiency6 and operating lifetime7 both decline with increasing current density (and thus 
luminance), it is especially difficult to meet the performance and lifetime targets set out for OLED lighting8. 
Improvements in optical outcoupling9–14 and the use of tandem OLED stacks15 are both beneficial from this 
standpoint, since they enable a given luminance to be achieved with lower current density. However, the 
current density reduction that can be achieved with these methods is limited, since outcoupling efficiency 
cannot exceed unity, and the number of stacks in a tandem OLED is limited to about six in practice16. 
Here, we introduce a new strategy to reduce OLED current density by constructing the device on a 
substrate with sub-mm, high aspect ratio surface texture. By creating more active OLED area per unit 
lighting panel area, the device current density required to generate a given panel luminance decreases. We 
demonstrate this approach using phosphorescent green and fluorescent blue OLEDs, and show that they 
can be fabricated with good thickness uniformity on corrugated substrates with area enhancement (AE) 
factors up to 1.4x using a standard vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE) coater. Green high aspect ratio 
devices can achieve the same luminance as a planar control at less than half the operating current density

due to a combination of both area and outcoupling enhancement. Fade testing on the blue devices confirms 
that the area enhancement is responsible for a 2.7-fold improvement in their operating lifetime relative to 
planar controls, indicating that the high aspect ratio approach is a viable pathway to improve the efficiency 
and lifetime of OLED lighting. 
Results 
Figure 1 illustrates the concept. Relative to a standard planar device, the same OLED layer stack on a 
triangular corrugated substrate with height-to-width aspect ratio, 𝜁= ℎ/𝑤, has a larger active OLED area 
(𝐴dev) per unit panel area (𝐴pan) by a factor of 𝛽AE ≡𝐴dev/𝐴pan = √1 + (2𝜁)2 . Thus, all other factors 
being equal, the high aspect ratio device can achieve the same panel luminance (𝐿pan) as its planar 
counterpart at lower current density, nominally by the same factor 𝛽AE. We emphasize that this strategy 
differs from prior work employing nanoscale substrate corrugation for improved optical outcoupling, where 
𝜁≪0.1 and 𝛽AE is negligible17–19, or 𝛽AE is not quantified20,21. Here, the 10-100 μm scale of the substrate 
texture is chosen to be much larger than the thickness of the OLED stack (so that the OLED can be 
considered locally planar from an electrical standpoint) while also being smaller than the visual acuity of 
the human eye (such that the panel luminance is perceived as spatially uniform).  
To test this concept, we fabricate proof-of-concept high aspect ratio devices on corrugated substrates 
using the replication molding process outlined in Fig. 2. Briefly, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds are 
cast using commercially available microprism sheets (e.g., brightness-enhancing film for automotive 
applications22) with 0.2 < 𝜁< 0.8 and periods ranging from 10 to 100 m. Then, ultraviolet (UV)-curable 
epoxy is poured onto the textured PDMS molds and the glass substrate is placed on top and cured (Fig. 2c); 
technical data for the epoxy resin is provided in Supplementary Note 1. The PDMS mold is subsequently 
peeled off, yielding the epoxy-on-glass high aspect ratio substrate (Fig. 2d). The refractive index of the

cured epoxy is approximately equal to that of the glass and thus Fresnel reflection at the internal epoxy/glass 
interface is negligible.  
Depositing an OLED layer stack with uniform thickness and no hot spots (i.e., locally thinner regions 
that could lead to shorting) is the key challenge for fabricating a high aspect ratio device. In this study, the 
indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode is deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering (Fig. 2e) and the rest of the 
OLED stack is deposited by standard VTE (Fig. 2f). Note that, due to the directional nature of VTE and the 
off-normal local deposition angle highlighted in Fig. 2f, the nominal thickness of the organic and cathode 
layers must be increased by a factor of [cos(𝜃dep)]−1 = 𝛽AE relative to a planar reference device to 
maintain the same thickness along the local substrate normal direction. 
Figure 3 presents the result of this process for a mock 𝛽AE = 2 OLED, where the ITO, organic layer, 
and cathode (Al) thicknesses are measured via the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) cross-sections in 
Fig. 3d-f. At the macroscale, the substrate texture is imperceptible and appears hazy to the naked eye (Fig. 
3a); at the microscale, the triangular facets are smooth and free from defects (Fig. 3b). Since the peak and 
valley vertices of the corrugation are sharp (~0.5 m radius of curvature), the planar facets account for the 
overwhelming majority of the OLED active area. The cross-sectional images show that the OLED layers 
are conformal, and that the peak (Fig. 3d) and valley (Fig. 3f) regions are locally thicker than the facets 
(Fig. 3e) as expected from the variation in local deposition angle23. Since increased OLED thickness 
generally leads to lower current at a given voltage, the vertex regions of the device are expected to be 
dimmer than the rest of the OLED but, crucially, should not be short-prone electrical hot spots. 
Figure 4 examines the layer thickness uniformity in more detail for the same organic layer stack 
deposited on three different substrate corrugation geometries with AE factors ranging from 𝛽AE = 1.1 to 
𝛽AE = 2.0. Figure 4b shows the variation in local thickness measured for each case. As expected from the 
local deposition angle (Fig. 2f), the thickness in the facet regions is less than in the vertex regions (at the 
edges and in the middle), roughly by a factor of 𝛽AE
−1 as shown in Fig. 4b. Hence, the nominal thickness, as

measured by the quartz crystal microbalance in the deposition chamber, must be increased by a factor of 
𝛽AE to achieve the same local layer thickness as on planar devices. Focusing on these facet regions since 
they make up the majority of the active OLED area, we find that the thickness variation (standard deviation) 
relative to the mean is less than 5% in all cases.  
Figure 5 shows that this level of thickness uniformity is sufficient to produce state-of-the-art green 
phosphorescent OLEDs. The thickness of each layer in the OLED stack except for the ITO anode (which 
is grown by sputtering) is adjusted via 𝛽AE to maintain the same facet thickness as a planar control device; 
full details of the device structure are provided in the Methods section. Figure 5a and 5b present photographs 
of the planar control, AE1.1 and AE1.4 corrugated devices along with their respective electroluminescence 
micrographs. The devices exhibit uniform emission except for the AE 1.1 case, where many dark spots are 
evident. These are attributed to a larger number of defects in the master mold used to produce the AE1.1 
texture. The dimmer vertical stripes in the AE1.4 device correspond to the valley vertices of the corrugation 
pattern, where the thicker OLED layer stack conducts less current. The peak vertices are out of focus in this 
image and correspond to the thin bright lines between the dim vertical stripes. Functional AE2.0 devices 
were also fabricated, but these tended to fail quickly and were not reproducible.  
Figure 5c shows the luminance-current-voltage characteristics for each device along with a second 
planar reference fabricated on commercial ITO. All of the devices exhibit comparably low shunt current at 
biases below ~2V, indicating that pinholes or other leakage pathways on the textured substrates are 
negligible. The devices display the same luminance turn-on voltage, though the planar commercial ITO 
device ultimately reaches higher current (and thus also luminance) due to its lower sheet resistance (14-15 
Ω/sq for the commercial ITO compared to 20-25 Ω/sq for the in-house sputtered ITO). Small differences 
are observed in the EL spectra of the devices (Fig. 5d), possibly due to variation in the ITO thickness (the 
only layer that was not corrected by 𝛽AE) as well as multiple scattering due to the substrate texture. The
