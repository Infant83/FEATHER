The normalized values of Al2O3/2LG/PI remained close to 1 up to 10 000 cycles, demonstrating a high cyclic stability.\nFigure 3(b) shows the relationship between the WVTR and crack density. The range of tensile strain is from 0% to 3%. Because permeation is dependent linearly on the defect radius (or the perimeter) instead of the area of defect, the WVTR of the whole barrier is linearly proportional to the multiplication of the mean radius and defect density . [...] However, in the case of Al2O3/2LG/PI, the WVTR increases with increasing crack density up to a strain of 2%, and after that, the WVTR continues to increase despite barely any noticeable incremental change in the crack density.\nIn addition, to conﬁrm the effect of 2LG under repeated loadings, the crack densities and WVTR values after per-forming the cyclic tests were measured. The cyclic tests were conducted under strain control at a frequency of 1 Hz. A mean strain of 2.5% and a strain amplitude of 0.5% were chosen by considering the elastic region of the PI substrate. The WVTR values and the crack densities were normalized by dividing the WVTR value and the crack density of Al2O3/2LG/PI after 1 cycle to conﬁrm a stability under cyclic loading. [...] Crack, is a type of defect, also deteriorates barrier char-acteristics, and the WVTR is strongly associated with crack density . Therefore, the relation between the WVTR and crack density was assumed to be linear. In the case of Al2O3/2LG/PI, along with the impact of crack density, the effects of buckling delamination and graphene barrier were combined. Therefore, the sections before and after the buck-ling delamination occurred were divided and the relationships between the WVTR and crack density were obtained. In general, the WVTR of the Al2O3/PI increased rapidly with high crack densities, while that of Al2O3/2LG/PI was low with low crack densities. In the case of Al2O3/PI, the WVTR increased with a slope of 0.13 as the strain increased. How-ever, for Al2O3/2LG/PI, the slope was as low", "score": 0.49245724, "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 3.54, "request_id": "f584425c-f4e6-4275-a71d-40f492816eef"}, "timestamp": 1768081688.185994}
