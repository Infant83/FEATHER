Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this tradeoff by constructing OLEDs on a substrate with sub-mm, high aspect ratio surface texture. By creating more active OLED area per unit lighting panel area, the device current density required to generate a given panel luminance decreases. We validate this approach for fluorescent and phosphorescent OLEDs, demonstrating good thickness uniformity on corrugated substrates with area enhancement factors up to 1.4x using a standard thermal ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS evaporator. Relative to planar controls at the same panel current density, the high aspect ratio devices achieve a 2.7-fold increase in operating lifetime and up to a 40% increase in external light extraction efficiency, indicating that this approach offers a powerful pathway to improve the efficiency and lifetime of OLED lighting. Keywords: OLED, reliability, lifetime, solid-state lighting, current density, luminance Introduction Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are widely used in mobile displays and flat panel televisions1–3 but have yet to penetrate the general lighting market4. One challenge unique to OLED lighting stems from the fact that lighting applications require roughly an order of magnitude higher luminance than displays5. Because OLED efficiency6 and operating lifetime7 both decline with increasing current density (and thus luminance), it is especially difficult to meet the performance and lifetime targets set out for OLED lighting8. Improvements in optical outcoupling9–14 and the use of tandem OLED stacks15 are both beneficial from this standpoint, since they enable a given luminance to be achieved with lower current density. However, the current density reduction that can be achieved with these methods is limited, since outcoupling efficiency cannot exceed unity, and the number of stacks in a tandem OLED is limited to about six in practice16. Here, we introduce a new strategy to reduce OLED current density by constructing the device on a substrate with sub-mm, high aspect ratio surface texture. By creating more active OLED area per unit lighting panel area, the device current density required to generate a given panel luminance decreases. We demonstrate this approach using phosphorescent green and fluorescent blue OLEDs, and show that they can be fabricated with good thickness uniformity on corrugated substrates with area enhancement (AE) factors up to 1.4x using a standard vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE) coater. Green high aspect ratio devices can achieve the same luminance as a planar control at less than half the operating current density ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS due to a combination of both area and outcoupling enhancement. Fade testing on the blue devices confirms that the area enhancement is responsible for a 2.7-fold improvement in their operating lifetime relative to planar controls, indicating that the high aspect ratio approach is a viable pathway to improve the efficiency and lifetime of OLED lighting. Results Figure 1 illustrates the concept. Relative to a standard planar device, the same OLED layer stack on a triangular corrugated substrate with height-to-width aspect ratio, 𝜁= ℎ/𝑤, has a larger active OLED area (𝐴dev) per unit panel area (𝐴pan) by a factor of 𝛽AE ≡𝐴dev/𝐴pan = √1 + (2𝜁)2 . Thus, all other factors being equal, the high aspect ratio device can achieve the same panel luminance (𝐿pan) as its planar counterpart at lower current density, nominally by the same factor 𝛽AE. We emphasize that this strategy differs from prior work employing nanoscale substrate corrugation for improved optical outcoupling, where 𝜁≪0.1 and 𝛽AE is negligible17–19, or 𝛽AE is not quantified20,21. Here, the 10-100 μm scale of the substrate texture is chosen to be much larger than the thickness of the OLED stack (so that the OLED can be considered locally planar from an electrical standpoint) while also being smaller than the visual acuity of the human eye (such that the panel luminance is perceived as spatially uniform). To test this concept, we fabricate proof-of-concept high aspect ratio devices on corrugated substrates using the replication molding process outlined in Fig. 2. Briefly, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds are cast using commercially available microprism sheets (e.g., brightness-enhancing film for automotive applications22) with 0.2 &lt; 𝜁&lt; 0.8 and periods ranging from 10 to 100 m. Then, ultraviolet (UV)-curable epoxy is poured onto the textured PDMS molds and the glass substrate is placed on top and cured (Fig. 2c); technical data for the epoxy resin is provided in Supplementary Note 1. The PDMS mold is subsequently peeled off, yielding the epoxy-on-glass high aspect ratio substrate (Fig. 2d). The refractive index of the ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS cured epoxy is approximately equal to that of the glass and thus Fresnel reflection at the internal epoxy/glass interface is negligible. Depositing an OLED layer stack with uniform thickness and no hot spots (i.e., locally thinner regions that could lead to shorting) is the key challenge for fabricating a high aspect ratio device. In this study, the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode is deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering (Fig. 2e) and the rest of the OLED stack is deposited by standard VTE (Fig. 2f). Note that, due to the directional nature of VTE and the off-normal local deposition angle highlighted in Fig. 2f, the nominal thickness of the organic and cathode layers must be increased by a factor of [cos(𝜃dep)]−1 = 𝛽AE relative to a planar reference device to maintain the same thickness along the local substrate normal direction. Figure 3 presents the result of this process for a mock 𝛽AE = 2 OLED, where the ITO, organic layer, and cathode (Al) thicknesses are measured via the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) cross-sections in Fig. 3d-f. At the macroscale, the substrate texture is imperceptible and appears hazy to the naked eye (Fig. 3a); at the microscale, the triangular facets are smooth and free from defects (Fig. 3b). Since the peak and valley vertices of the corrugation are sharp (~0.5 m radius of curvature), the planar facets account for the overwhelming majority of the OLED active area. The cross-sectional images show that the OLED layers are conformal, and that the peak (Fig. 3d) and valley (Fig. 3f) regions are locally thicker than the facets (Fig. 3e) as expected from the variation in local deposition angle23. Since increased OLED thickness generally leads to lower current at a given voltage, the vertex regions of the device are expected to be dimmer than the rest of the OLED but, crucially, should not be short-prone electrical hot spots. Figure 4 examines the layer thickness uniformity in more detail for the same organic layer stack deposited on three different substrate corrugation geometries with AE factors ranging from 𝛽AE = 1.1 to 𝛽AE = 2.0. Figure 4b shows the variation in local thickness measured for each case. As expected from the local deposition angle (Fig. 2f), the thickness in the facet regions is less than in the vertex regions (at the edges and in the middle), roughly by a factor of 𝛽AE −1 as shown in Fig. 4b. Hence, the nominal thickness, as ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS measured by the quartz crystal microbalance in the deposition chamber, must be increased by a factor of 𝛽AE to achieve the same local layer thickness as on planar devices. Focusing on these facet regions since they make up the majority of the active OLED area, we find that the thickness variation (standard deviation) relative to the mean is less than 5% in all cases. Figure 5 shows that this level of thickness uniformity is sufficient to produce state-of-the-art green phosphorescent OLEDs. The thickness of each layer in the OLED stack except for the ITO anode (which is grown by sputtering) is adjusted via 𝛽AE to maintain the same facet thickness as a planar control device; full details of the device structure are provided in the Methods section. Figure 5a and 5b present photographs of the planar control, AE1.1 and AE1.4 corrugated devices along with their respective electroluminescence micrographs. The devices exhibit uniform emission except for the AE 1.1 case, where many dark spots are evident. These are attributed to a larger number of defects in the master mold used to produce the AE1.1 texture. The dimmer vertical stripes in the AE1.4 device correspond to the valley vertices of the corrugation pattern, where the thicker OLED layer stack conducts less current. The peak vertices are out of focus in this image and correspond to the thin bright lines between the dim vertical stripes. Functional AE2.0 devices were also fabricated, but these tended to fail quickly and were not reproducible. Figure 5c shows the luminance-current-voltage characteristics for each device along with a second planar reference fabricated on commercial ITO. All of the devices exhibit comparably low shunt current at biases below ~2V, indicating that pinholes or other leakage pathways on the textured substrates are negligible. The devices display the same luminance turn-on voltage, though the planar commercial ITO device ultimately reaches higher current (and thus also luminance) due to its lower sheet resistance (14-15 Ω/sq for the commercial ITO compared to 20-25 Ω/sq for the in-house sputtered ITO). Small differences are observed in the EL spectra of the devices (Fig. 5d), possibly due to variation in the ITO thickness (the only layer that was not corrected by 𝛽AE) as well as multiple scattering due to the substrate texture. The ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS angular emission profile measured in the plane orthogonal to the corrugation (Fig. 5d, inset) is close to Lambertian for all of the devices except for the AE 1.1 case. Figure 6a shows that the high aspect devices have significantly higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) than the planar controls. This is attributed to efficient outcoupling of substrate modes by scattering from the corrugated texture, since the OLED layer structure of each device (and thus the internal quantum efficiency) is nominally the same. Defining the outcoupling enhancement factor, 𝛽oc, as the ratio of the high aspect device EQE to the planar control yields 𝛽oc ≈1.6 and 𝛽oc ≈1.4 for the AE1.1 and AE1.4 devices, respectively (Fig. 6a, right-hand axis). These enhancement factors are consistent with ray tracing simulations described in Supplementary Note 2. In both cases, the high aspect device outcoupling enhancement exceeds that achieved by applying an external light extraction film to a planar device (star symbols) and is comparable to the ~1.5x enhancement enabled by using a microlens array9 or other scattering strategies24,25. Figure 6b presents the panel luminance (𝐿pan) versus 𝐽dev for each device, highlighting the lower device current density needed for the high aspect devices to reach a luminance of 5000 cd m-2 compared with the planar controls. This reduction is due to the combined effect of outcoupling enhancement and area enhancement. Higher 𝛽oc means less current is required to produce a given light output, and higher 𝛽AE means that this reduced current flows through a larger device active area, further decreasing the local current density. The total reduction factor in 𝐽dev for a given panel luminance is therefore equal to the product, 𝛽oc𝛽AE, in good agreement with the data as shown in Fig. 6c. Similar improvements are observed for blue fluorescent OLEDs (see Methods for the device structure) fabricated on high aspect ratio substrates in Figure 7. The EQE enhancement of the AE1.1 and AE1.4 devices in Fig. 7b is lower in this case compared with that of the green devices in Fig. 6 because the epoxy has parasitic absorption in the blue spectral region (owing to its UV-curable formulation; see Supplementary Note 3 for the transmission spectrum) that attenuates multiply-scattered light in the substrate. Figure 7c ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS presents luminance fade results for the AE1.1, AE1.4 device and the commercial ITO planar control, demonstrating a 2.7-fold increase in LT95 lifetime (𝜏95, defined as the time required to reach 95% of initial luminance) for the AE1.4 device. Note that the devices are aged at a constant panel current density of 𝐽pan = 3 mA cm-2 (corresponding to an initial luminance of 𝐿0 ≈200 cd m-2 for the planar control devices) instead of constant panel luminance to avoid conflating changes in lifetime with changes in outcoupling efficiency. Fade measurements for the planar and high aspect ratio green devices are presented in Supplementary Note 4. The pre- and post-fade EL micrographs in Fig. 7c show that dark spots form over the course of aging in both the AE1.4 and commercial planar co</pre></main>
