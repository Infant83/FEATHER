Relative to planar controls at the same panel current density, the high aspect ratio devices achieve a 2.7-fold increase in operating lifetime and up to a 40% increase in external light extraction efficiency, indicating that this approach offers a powerful pathway to improve the efficiency and lifetime of OLED lighting.

ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS Editorial Summary Reliability remains challenging for organic light-emitting diodes used in solid-state lighting. Here, the authors reduce the current density needed for a given brightness by fabricating devices on a high aspect ratio substrate with sub-mm texture, resulting in a 2.7x increase in operating lifetime.

Hence, the nominal thickness, as ARTICLE IN PRESS ARTICLE IN PRESS measured by the quartz crystal microbalance in the deposition chamber, must be increased by a factor of 𝛽AE to achieve the same local layer thickness as on planar devices. Focusing on these facet regions since they make up the majority of the active OLED area, we find that the thickness variation (standard deviation) relative to the mean is less than 5% in all cases. Figure 5 shows that this level of thickness uniformity is sufficient to produce state-of-the-art green phosphorescent OLEDs.

[...] ARTICLE IN PRESS cured epoxy is approximately equal to that of the glass and thus Fresnel reflection at the internal epoxy/glass interface is negligible. Depositing an OLED layer stack with uniform thickness and no hot spots (i.e., locally thinner regions that could lead to shorting) is the key challenge for fabricating a high aspect ratio device. In this study, the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode is deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering (Fig. 2e) and the rest of the OLED stack is deposited by standard VTE (Fig. 2f). Note that, due to the directional nature of VTE and the off-normal local deposition angle highlighted in Fig. 2f, the nominal thickness of the organic and cathode layers must be increased by a factor of [cos(𝜃dep)]−1 = 𝛽AE relative to a planar reference device to maintain&quot;,
