By the end of 2025, roughly one in six people worldwide were using generative artificial intelligence, but a growing "digital divide" means that wealthy nations are adopting these tools much faster than developing ones. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Singapore are currently the world leaders in AI usage, while the United States ranks lower in actual population usage despite inventing much of the technology. South Korea saw the biggest improvement recently, jumping up the rankings because of government support and new AI models that work much better in the Korean language. Meanwhile, a free Chinese AI platform called DeepSeek has become very popular in Africa and other regions by removing cost barriers, challenging American companies in places where access to technology has traditionally been limited.

### Transcript:
Welcome to the AI Papers podcast daily. Today we are doing a deep dive into the well the astonishing roll out of generative AI across the globe and it's a story that's also deeply uneven. We're looking at what happens when the fastest growing technology in history collides with, you know, global economic inequality, >> right? It's the central tension really of any new powerful technology. When a tool like this appears, a tool that offers so much leverage, the speed at which it spreads, well, that decides who gets a huge advantage, maybe even an insurmountable one. >> And our source for this deep dive, it's uh it's the Microsoft AI diffusion report. It was just published January 2026, and it meticulously tracks generative AI usage for the entire second half of 2025. And here's the headline and finding them that really grabbed us. Global adoption has hit 16.3% of the working age population. And you really have to stop and think about that number for a second. That's about one in six people worldwide actively using these tools. I mean, if you're in a meeting, that's the new baseline. The speed is just incredible for a tech that what two years ago barely existed in the public sphere. >> Okay, so if adoption is soaring, what's the what's the problem here then? >> The problem, and this is really the whole mission of our deep dive today, is the paradox at the heart of the report. This incredible progress is also driving a uh a critical and widening digital divide. We're not just seeing an unequal distribution of the benefits. >> We're seeing an acceleration of the inequality itself. >> Exactly. We need to unpack the how and the why this gap is growing and maybe a little more optimistically look at the few success stories that managed to beat that trend. >> All right, let's start with the basics. Then to trust these numbers, we have to understand the methodology. What exactly are they measuring with this term AI diffusion? >> Yeah, that's a crucial point to clarify because you know everyone measures usage a little differently. So in this report, AI diffusion is defined as the share of the working age population. So think roughly 18 to 65 who have used a generative AI product at least once in that six-month period. >> So it's a binary thing. Have you used it? Yes or no? >> Exactly. Did you engage with the tech? That's the question. That sounds simple enough for one person, but how on earth do you gather reliable data like that across more than a hundred countries all with, you know, different levels of internet access and tech, >> right? And that's where the methodology gets pretty complex but also pretty solid. The raw data, it comes from aggregated and anonymized Microsoft telemetry. So basically usage patterns across their own ecosystem. >> Okay. But that would just tell you who's using Microsoft products. >> Precisely. So they don't stop there. They run these really sophisticated statistical adjustments to normalize that data against three key variables for each country >> and those are >> okay so first they adjust for local market share differences in operating systems and devices you know since not everyone is on Windows or using office makes >> sense >> second they account for the overall internet penetration in that country if only half the population is online you can't really expect 100% adoption >> of course >> and finally they adjust for population size to make sure they're always comparing the share share of the working age population, not just a raw number of users. >> That sounds critical. Without those adjustments, you'd just be measuring who uses a particular brand of software, not actual global diffusion. >> Exactly. And look, no single metric is ever going to be perfect, especially for something moving this fast. But the report makes a very convincing case that this is the strongest, most comprehensive cross-country measure we have today. >> Let you compare apples to apples >> from Singapore to South Africa. Yeah. >> Okay. So, let's get to those numbers because this is where that central conflict really comes into focus. >> Yeah. >> Globally, adoption went from 15.1% in the first half of 2025 up to 16.3% in the second half, >> right? A 1.2 percentage point increase worldwide, which sounds pretty good on its own, >> but the devil's in the details. >> It is. You have to look at where that 1.2 points actually came from. So, the global north, your traditionally highincome developed economies, their adoption rate grew by 1.8%. eight percentage points. Now, compare that with the global south, and that's a term for countries with uh lower levels of economic development, often in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which only grew by 1.0 a percentage point. >> Wow, that is a massive disparity. The high-income economies are basically running almost twice as fast. >> And that speed difference is what accelerates the inequality. We already had a digital divide with internet access, >> and now we're layering a AI usage chasm right on top of it. >> Exactly. The current usage level in the global north is 24.7%. So call it 1 in4 working age adults. But in the global south it's just 14.1%. That's closer to 1 in seven. >> That's such a powerful way to visualize it. If you're in a meeting room in say Western Europe, there's a good chance two or three people in that room have used these tools. But in a similar meeting in a lower inome country, you might only find one. >> And the result is that measurable acceleration of the gap. The divide itself widened from 9.8 8 percentage points in the first half of the year to 10.6 percentage points by the end of it. So the promise was democratization, but the reality of 2025 was well the opposite. The rich capitalized faster. >> So if the global north is pulling away, what is the top of that leaderboard look like? Is it just the biggest economies, the US and China? >> Not at all. And this is one of the most interesting findings. The very top of the rankings shows that national policy, not just sheer economic scale, is the single most critical factor. >> So who is it? The list is dominated by economies that made early, very deliberate investments in digital infrastructure and just focused relentlessly on AI skilling. >> We're talking about the UAE in Singapore, right? >> Absolutely. The UAE is leading the world at 64.0% adoption. >> 64%. >> And Singapore is right behind them at 60.9%. And these numbers are not accidents. They are the direct result of strategic decisions made years and years ago. >> Okay, so the UAE is the big case study here. What did they do that gave them such a massive head start? >> The key thing to understand is that the UAE didn't just react to the generative AI boom in 2023. They built a strategic buffer years before the tech even hit critical mass. They laid the groundwork way back in October 2017. >> 2017, that's 5 years before Chad GPT. >> Five full years. They appointed the world's first minister of state for artificial intelligence. >> So 5 years of institutional prep work. What did that actually mean on the ground when the boom finally hit? >> It meant they weren't scrambling. They were ready to integrate. They already had a national AI strategy. They had nine priority sectors identified. And crucially, that long-term government commitment, it translated directly into public confidence. The 2025 Edelman trust barometer found public trust in AI in the UAE was around 67%. >> And that trust level is a huge driver of adoption. >> It is. Now contrast that 67% with the US or Western Europe where AI trust averages only 32%. >> A 35 point trust gap. >> That gap is arguably more important than any single infrastructure investment because if people don't trust the tools or the institutions using them, they just won't adopt them at scale. >> And their regulatory approach was different, too. They didn't let fear paralyze innovation. >> Correct. They were very pragmatic. They created things like sandbox environments for controlled experiments. Use principles-based guidelines instead of rigid rules. and they use special visa programs to actively pull in global AI talent. It was all about building AI that works that people can see working which in turn builds more trust. >> Okay, now let's pivot to a country that leads the world in creating AI that seems to be lagging in using it. The United States, the US develops most of the frontier models we talk about every day. Yet, the report shows it actually dropped a spot from 23rd and 24th in usage, only 28.3%. And this is what the report calls the US paradox. It's fascinating, right? It tells you that leading in R&D and having the best infrastructure, that alone does not guarantee broad democratic adoption across your population. >> So why is the US lagging? What are the theories? >> Well, the report points to a couple of interwoven factors. First, you've got the sheer fragmentation of US policy. Unlike that unified top- down strategy in the UAE, US policy is all over the place. It's fragmented across different states, different sectors, private companies. There's no single national push. >> And what about cost? >> That's the second point. Cost barriers might still be a factor. Yes, there are tons of free tools, but the most advanced, the most reliable ones, the ones that really give you a productivity boost. They're often still behind a subscription payw wall that creates a friction point for the general population. So smaller, highly digitized economies with these focused national strategies are actually pulling ahead in population share. >> Exactly. It proves that policy focused on diffusion matters just as much, maybe more than policy focused on creation. >> And that is the perfect segue to the clearest success story from the second half of 2025. South Korea. They surged seven spots in the rankings from 25th to 18th. Their usage grew from around 26% to over 30%. They absolutely nailed the diffusion challenge. >> They really did. And the report breaks down their success into three powerful drivers that all happened at the same time. The first one was just this renewed very concrete national policy push. >> What did that look like? >> Well, in the second half of 2025, they established the National AI Strategy Committee. This is a powerful cross ministerial body. It gives AI policy real teeth. And crucially, they passed the AI basic act that gave everyone, companies, the public a stable legal framework. It balanced innovation with governance. >> And they were also building up the talent pipeline, not just writing laws. >> Yes. Expanding AI focused high schools, strengthening university partnerships. They created these formal systemic ways to scale AI adoption really, really quickly. >> Okay, so that's policy. The second driver is the one I find most exciting because it's about linguistic equity. the models just got way way better in Korean. >> This really was the aha moment. It's so important for Korean speakers. Like for so many non-English speakers, the early models were just they were unreliable, full of translation errors, frankly, kind of useless for professional work, but the release of GPT4 and then GPT5 just completely changed the game. And you can see this measured on the Korean SAT, the CS benchmark. >> Give us those numbers again because the jump is just staggering. >> Okay, listen to this. the best free model in early 2024. GPT3.5, it scored a 16 on the CSA. That's that's below adult reading proficiency. >> Wow. >> Then GPT40 comes out in April 2025 and it jumps to a 75. And then GPT5 in August, a perfect 100. >> That's just that's explosive. You're going from a useless novelty to a tool that performs on par with a top tier college student in a few months. And that's the difference between a tool you can't trust and a tool you have to use to stay competitive. That massive functional leap in reliability. That's what unlocked sustained adoption for millions of Korean professionals and students. >> And then there's the third driver which is more of a consumer spark. The kind of accidental on-ramp that introduced the tech to everybody else. >> Yes. The cultural phenomenon. It was the viral spread of those Giblly style images made with chatgpt 40 in April. >> I remember those. They were everywhere. >> Exactly. It was simple. It was instantly sharable. You needed zero technical skill. And the report shows this moment introduced image generation to millions of firsttime users. And crucially, a lot of them stuck around. They started with a meme and then moved on to explore the more serious features. >> So you have this perfect recipe, smart policy, a huge leap in linguistic quality, and an easy fun entry point for consumers. But we have to go back to that widening global divide because that forces us to talk about the big disruptor of 2025, the rise of Deepseek. >> Deepseek is basically the market's answer to the access problem. It's a totally different approach to AI adoption because it was built specifically to target that gap in the global south. It's highly capable, open- source, and most importantly, it's completely free. >> How did being free and open source let it take off so quickly in those underserved markets? Well, it removed both the financial and the technical barriers at the same time. It was released under an MIT license, so anyone can use it or build on it. No proprietary lock in. And they offered a totally free chatbot. So, where the Western models put their best features behind a payw wall, DeepSeek just gave them away. >> And that allowed it to grab huge market share in places that Western models either overlooked or couldn't operate in. >> That is the critical takeaway. Its uptake was, you know, minimal in North America and Western Europe where you have these entrenched alternatives, but it just surged in China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, Bellarus, and most notably across the African continent. Its usage rates are estimated to be two to four times higher than competing Western models. >> And this wasn't just organic, was it? There was a geopolitical angle here, strategic push. >> Absolutely. The report is very explicit about this. It links deepseek success to strategic promotion by Chinese tech firms especially infrastructure partners like Huawei in African and Asian markets. >> So AI diffusion is now an instrument of geopolitical influence. >> It is the competition between US and Chinese aligned models is now being fought in the open- source community using affordability and access as a weapon. >> So on one hand deepseek is a huge win. It's lowered the barrier to entry. It suggests the next billion AI users will come from the global south. But there's a big challenge there too, isn't there? >> Yes, there is. The rapid spread of a powerful open model one that spreads with very little centrali
