Global AI Adoption in 2025 
A Widening Digital Divide

Global AI Adoption in 2025 — A Widening Digital Divide
Executive Summary
Global adoption of artificial intelligence continued to rise 
in the second half of 2025, increasing by 1.2 percentage 
points compared to the first half of the year, with roughly 
one in six people worldwide now using generative AI tools, 
remarkable progress for a technology that only recently 
entered mainstream use. 
Despite progress in AI adoption, the data shows a widening 
divide: adoption in the Global North grew nearly twice as fast 
as in the Global South. As a result, 24.7 percent of the working 
age population in the Global North is now using these tools, 
compared to only 14.1 percent in the Global South.

To track this trend, we measure AI diffusion as the share of 
people worldwide who have used a generative AI product 
during the reported period. This measure is derived from 
aggregated and anonymized Microsoft telemetry and then 
adjusted to reflect differences in OS and device-market 
share, internet penetration, and country population. 
Additional details on the methodology are available in 
our AI Diffusion technical paper. [1]
No single metric is perfect, and this one is no exception. 
Through the Microsoft AI Economy Institute, we continue 
to refine how we measure AI diffusion globally, including 
how adoption varies across countries in ways that 
best advance priorities such as scientific discovery and 
productivity gains. For this report, we rely on the strongest 
cross-country measure available today, and we expect to 
complement it over time with additional indicators as they 
emerge and mature.

Global AI Adoption in 2025 — A Widening Digital Divide
Countries that have invested early in digital infrastructure, 
AI skilling, and government adoption, such as the United 
Arab Emirates, Singapore, Norway, Ireland, France, and 
Spain, continue to lead. The UAE extended its lead as the 
#1 ranked country, with 64.0 percent of the working age 
population using AI at the end of 2025, compared to 59.4 
percent earlier in the year. The UAE has opened a lead of 
more than three percentage points over Singapore, which 
continues in second place with 60.9 percent adoption.
The second half of the year in the United States shows that 
leadership in innovation and infrastructure, while critical, 
does not by themselves lead to broad AI adoption. The 
U.S. leads in both AI infrastructure and frontier model 
development, but it fell from 23rd to 24th place in AI usage 
among the working age population, with a 28.3 percent 
usage rate. It lags far behind smaller, more highly digitized 
and AI-focused economies.
South Korea stands out as the clearest end-of-year 
success story. It surged seven spots in the global rankings, 
climbing from 25th to 18th, driven by government policies, 
improved frontier model capabilities in the Korean 
language, and consumer-facing features that resonated 
with the population. Generative AI is now used in schools, 
workplaces, and public services, and South Korea has 
become one of ChatGPT’s fastest-growing markets, leading 
OpenAI to open an office in Seoul. [2]
A parallel development reshaping the global landscape 
in 2025 was the rapid rise of DeepSeek, an open-source 
AI platform that has gained significant traction in markets 
long underserved by traditional providers. By releasing its 
model under an open-source MIT license and offering a 
completely free chatbot, DeepSeek removed both financial 
and technical barriers that limit access to advanced AI. Its 
strongest adoption, not surprisingly has emerged across 
China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Belarus. But perhaps even 
more notable is DeepSeek’s surging popularity across 
Africa, where it is aided by strategic promotion and 
partnerships with firms such as Huawei. [3] 
This rapid evolution underscores an increasingly important 
dimension of AI competition between the United States 
and China, involving a race to promote adoption of their 
respective national models. DeepSeek’s success reflects 
growing Chinese momentum across Africa, a trend that 
may continue to accelerate in 2026. DeepSeek’s ascent 
also underscores a broader truth: the global diffusion of AI 
is influenced by accessibility factors, and the next wave of 
users may come from communities that have historically 
had limited access to technological progress. The challenge 
ahead is ensuring that innovation spreads in ways that help 
narrow divides rather than deepen them.

Global AI Adoption in 2025 — A Widening Digital Divide
New data from the second half of 2025 shows the world 
is using artificial intelligence at record levels, but it also 
reveals a widening divide. Global adoption of generative 
AI tools reached 16.3 percent of the world’s population, 
up from 15.1 percent in the first half of 2025, a 
meaningful gain for technologies still in their early years. 
Today, roughly one in six people are using AI to learn, 
work, or solve problems.
Yet this progress is uneven. Adoption in the Global North 
grew almost twice as fast as in the Global South, widening 
the gap from 9.8 to 10.6 percentage points. In short, AI’s 
benefits are expanding, but they are not expanding equally.
When looking at the economies driving the fastest 
gains, the imbalance becomes even clearer. Of the ten 
countries with the largest increases in AI adoption share, 
all are high-income economies. South Korea and the 
United Arab Emirates stand out, each posting growth 
rates above four percentage points, underscoring how 
concentrated recent momentum has been among already 
AI-established economies.

Global AI Adoption in 2025 — A Widening Digital Divide
Among the top 30 countries, the overall rankings remained 
steady. Nations that have invested early and consistently 
in digital infrastructure continue to lead. The United Arab 
Emirates and Singapore again hold the top two positions, 
followed by Norway, Ireland, France, and Spain. Most other 
countries shifted little, reinforcing how saturated the top of 
the list has become.
A few changes stand out. South Korea made the largest 
move of the half, rising seven spots from 25th to 18th, a clear 
signal of accelerated national investment and adoption. 
Belgium moved ahead of Canada, and the Netherlands 
passed the United Kingdom, but these were modest 
adjustments in an otherwise stable group. The United 
States maintained strong usage in absolute numbers, but 
dropped from 23rd to 24th place, reflecting the fact that a 
smaller proportion of the US population uses AI compared 
to several smaller highly digitized nations.
Taken together, the data shows a world embracing AI at 
remarkable speed, even as the divide between leading and 
lagging regions grows. The challenge ahead is ensuring 
that this next wave of innovation benefits more people, in 
more places, and not fewer.
