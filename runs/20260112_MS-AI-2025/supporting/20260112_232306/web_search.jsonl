Addressing limitations of prior approaches—which often rely on self-reported surveys, firm-level data, or usage metrics confined to internet users—our method-ology leverages direct usage from Microsoft telemetry. By integrating the proportion of active Microsoft AI users with estimates of device penetration and mobile usage patterns, we generate a consistent, country-level measure of actual AI engagement across the full demographic. This population-centric framework provides a vital benchmark for policymakers and researchers needing a reliable, globally comparable view to track AI diffusion and [...] Nevertheless, our methodology carries some limitations. Because our metric originates with Microsoft telemetry, it is inherently biased toward desktop platforms and the Microsoft user demographic. Although we apply rigorous adjustments and scaling factors, our results implicitly assume that user behavior in Microsoft products approximates that in other platforms, which may not always hold true. Future iterations of this research could mitigate this limitation by integrating data from mobile app analytics providers such as Sensor Tower or leveraging web traffic analytics from tools like Semrush or SimilarWeb. Expanding data sources would help generalize our insights to the broader digital population and improve estimates of global AI usage comprehensively. [...] Measuring AI Diffusion: A Population-Normalized Metric for Tracking Global AI Usage Amit Misra∗ , Jane Wang∗ , Scott McCullers, Kevin White, and Juan Lavista Ferres Microsoft AI for Good Lab Abstract Measuring global AI diffusion remains challenging due to a lack of population-normalized, cross-country usage data. We introduce AI User Share, a novel indicator that estimates the share of each country’s working-age population actively using AI tools. Built from anonymized Microsoft telemetry and adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, this metric spans 147 economies and provides consistent, real-time insight into global AI diffusion.

Microsoft’s inaugural AI Diffusion Reportoffers a comprehensive look at how AI adoption is accelerating worldwide, drawing on data from more than 100 countries. In less than three years, more than 1.2 billion people have used AI tools, a rate of adoption faster than the internet, the personal computer, or even the smartphone. This rapid diffusion underscores AI’s potential as a general-purpose technology but also highlights the urgent need to ensure equitable access. [...] The report introduces three indices—the AI Frontier Index, the AI Infrastructure Index, and the AI Diffusion Index—to help policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders understand where breakthroughs are happening, where capacity exists to scale, and where AI is being used to improve lives. These insights show that adoption is fastest where connectivity and digital infrastructure are strongest, while nearly four billion people still lack the basics needed to participate in the AI economy. Bridging this gap is essential to avoid deepening global divides. [...] Beyond the numbers, the report illustrates the need for collaborative action to expand access to digital infrastructure, strengthen skills development, and promote responsible AI policies. By investing in these foundational elements, governments and organizations can unlock AI’s potential for growth and innovation. The data makes clear that speed alone does not guarantee shared prosperity—broad accessibility does.\n\nTo explore the full findings and recommendations, read the AI Diffusion Report.\n\nTags: AI, artificial intelligence, infrastructure\n\nFollow us:\n\n Check us out on RSS", "score": 0.49509352, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://aimagazine.com/news/microsofts-report-inside-the-global-ai-adoption-divide", "title": "Microsoft's Report: Inside the Global AI Adoption Divide - AI Magazine", "content": "AI adoption in the Global North runs at roughly double the rate of the Global South, with the chasm becoming particularly pronounced in countries where GDP per capita falls below US$20,000.\n\nThe report, which draws on aggregated telemetry from over one billion Windows devices alongside data from major AI platforms including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, exposes the extent of digital inequality in the age of AI.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, 59.4% of working-age adults use AI tools.
