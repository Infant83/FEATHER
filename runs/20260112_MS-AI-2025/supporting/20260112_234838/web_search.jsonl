Despite progress in AI adoption, the data shows a widening divide: adoption in the Global North grew nearly twice as fast as in the Global South. As a result, 24.7 percent of the working age population in the Global North is now using these tools, compared to only 14.1 percent in the Global South. [...] using artificial intelligence at record levels, but it also reveals a widening divide. Global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3 percent of the world’s population, up from 15.1 percent in the first half of 2025, a meaningful gain for technologies still in their early years.

Addressing limitations of prior approaches—which often rely on self-reported surveys, firm-level data, or usage metrics confined to internet users—our method-ology leverages direct usage from Microsoft telemetry. By integrating the proportion of active Microsoft AI users with estimates of device penetration and mobile usage patterns, we generate a consistent, country-level measure of actual AI engagement across the full demographic.

The study measures AI adoption as the share of consumers who used a generative AI product during the reported period. This metric is based on aggregated and anonymized Microsoft telemetry data, adjusted for differences in operating system and device-market share, internet penetration, and country populations. [...] The report notes that of the ten countries with the largest adoption gains, all are classified as high-income economies, underscoring that recent adoption growth remains concentrated in nations with established digital infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft emphasizes that no single metric is perfect. The AI Economy Institute continues refining its measurement of AI diffusion globally and expects to complement its current metric with additional indicators as they become available. [...] According to the report, 16.3% of the global population used generative AI tools in the second half of 2025, up from 15.1% in the first half, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points. This means roughly one in six people globally are now using these technologies.\n\nThe report highlights a growing disparity between regions. In the Global North, 24.7% of the working-age population used AI tools in H2 2025, compared to 14.1% in the Global South.

Its strongest adoption, not surprisingly has emerged across China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Belarus. But perhaps even more notable is DeepSeek’s surging popularity across Africa, where it is aided by strategic promotion and partnerships with firms such as Huawei.  This rapid evolution underscores an increasingly important dimension of AI competition between the United States and China, involving a race to promote adoption of their respective national models.

The absence of subscription fees or payment requirements lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price‑sensitive regions. Reflecting this open ethos, the company invited independent researchers in September 2025 to rigorously test the model’s performance, aiming for publication in Nature, an unusually transparent move for an emerging AI player.  This combination of openness and affordability allowed DeepSeek to gain traction in markets underserved by Western AI platforms.
