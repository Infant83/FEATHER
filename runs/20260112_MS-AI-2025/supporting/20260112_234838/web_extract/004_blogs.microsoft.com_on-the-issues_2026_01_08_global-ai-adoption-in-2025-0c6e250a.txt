Read the full [Global AI Adoption Report.](https://aka.ms/AIDiffusionReport2025)

Global adoption of artificial intelligence continued to rise in the second half of 2025, increasing by 1.2 percentage points compared to the first half of the year, with roughly one in six people worldwide now using generative AI tools,remarkable progress for a technology that only recently entered mainstream use.

To track this trend, we measure AI diffusion as the share of people worldwide who have used a generative AI product during the reported period. This measure is derived from aggregated and anonymized Microsoft telemetry and then adjusted to reflect differences in OS and device-market share, internet penetration, and country population. Additional details on the methodology are available in our AI Diffusion technical paper.[[1]](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/08/global-ai-adoption-in-2025/#_ftn1)

No single metric is perfect, and this one is no exception. Through the Microsoft AI Economy Institute, we continue to refine how we measure AI diffusion globally, including how adoption varies across countries in ways that best advance priorities such as scientific discovery and productivity gains. For this report, we rely on the strongest cross-country measure available today, and we expect to complement it over time with additional indicators as they emerge and mature.

Despite progress in AI adoption,the data shows a widening divide: adoption in the Global North grew nearly twice as fast as in the Global South. As a result, 24.7 percent of the working age population in the Global North is now using these tools, compared to only 14.1 percent in the Global South.

Countries that have invested early in digital infrastructure, AI skilling, and government adoption, such as the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Norway, Ireland, France, and Spain, continue to lead. The UAE extended its lead as the #1 ranked country, with 64.0 percent of the working age population using AI at the end of 2025, compared to 59.4 percent earlier in the year. The UAE has opened a lead of more than three percentage points over Singapore, which continues in second place with 60.9 percent adoption.

The second half of the year in the United States shows that leadership in innovation and infrastructure,while critical, does not by themselves lead to broad AI adoption. The U.S.leads in both AI infrastructure and frontier model development,but it fell from 23rd to 24th place in AI usage among the working age population, with a 28.3 percent usage rate.It lags far behind smaller, more highly digitized and AI-focused economies.

South Korea stands out as the clearest end-of-year success story. It surged seven spots in the global rankings, climbing from 25 th to 18 th, driven by government policies, improved frontier model capabilities in the Korean language, and consumer-facing features that resonated with the population.Generative AI is now used in schools, workplaces, and public services, and South Korea has become one of ChatGPT’s fas
