# Global AI adoption reaches record levels in 2025

*Open-source AI platforms such as DeepSeek are lowering barriers, enabling adoption in regions with limited access to traditional AI services.*

Global adoption of generative AI [continued to rise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/topics/AI-Economy-Institute/reports/Global-AI-Adoption-2025/) in the second half of 2025, reaching 16.3 percent of the world’s population. Around one in six people now use AI tools for work, learning, and problem-solving, marking rapid progress for a technology still in its early years.

Adoption remains uneven, with the Global North growing nearly twice as fast as the Global South. Countries with early investments in [digital infrastructure](https://dig.watch/updates/softbank-invests-4-billion-in-global-ai-networks) and AI policies, including the UAE, Singapore, and South Korea, lead the way.

South Korea saw the most significant gain, rising seven spots globally due to government initiatives, improved Korean-language models, and viral consumer trends.

The UAE maintains its lead, benefiting from years of foresight, including early AI strategy, dedicated ministries, and regulatory frameworks that foster trust and widespread usage.

Meanwhile, open-source platforms such as [DeepSeek](https://dig.watch/updates/v3-2-models-signal-renewed-deepseek-momentum) are expanding access in underserved markets, including Africa, China, and Iran, lowering financial and technical barriers for millions of new users.

While AI adoption grows globally, disparities persist. Policymakers and developers face the challenge of ensuring that the next wave of AI users benefits broader communities, narrowing divides rather than deepening them.
