South Korea emerged as the fastest-growing country in artificial intelligence adoption in the second half of 2025, marking a major turning point in the global AI race. According to a recent AI diffusion report released by Microsoft, Korea recorded the largest increase in AI usage among surveyed nations and climbed seven places in global rankings in just six months.

The report highlights Korea as a rare case where AI has moved beyond the realm of emerging technology and settled firmly into everyday life. In the first half of 2025, 25.9% of Koreans reported using generative AI. By the end of the year, that figure had jumped to 30.7%. A rise of 4.8 percentage points in half a year was the biggest increase observed worldwide.

As a result, South Korea’s global ranking in AI adoption rose from 25th to 18th, making it the most notable mover in the second half of the year.

**Government Policy Set the Pace**

One of the clearest drivers behind Korea’s rapid rise was government action. In late 2025, the country moved decisively from policy discussion to execution.

In September, Seoul officially launched the National AI Strategy Committee, a cross-ministerial body designed to act as a centralized AI control tower. Around the same time, the AI Basic Act came into effect, defining clear boundaries for regulation and promotion. For businesses and public institutions alike, the message was simple. The rules were finally clear.

Education and talent policies followed. AI-focused science high schools were expanded, and partnerships between regional universities and research institutes were strengthened. This helped push AI experimentation beyond the Seoul metropolitan area, bringing students, public servants, and small businesses into direct contact with real-world AI tools.

Microsoft’s data shows that Korea’s AI user base grew by 81.4% from the first half to the second half of 2025. Most countries recorded growth in the 20% to 40% range. Korea stood alone.

**Korean Language AI Reached a Tipping Point**

Technology itself also played a critical role. The mainstream rollout of GPT-4o in May 2025, followed by the release of GPT-5 in August, dramatically changed how Korean users experienced AI.

Measured against Korea’s college entrance exam benchmarks, AI performance evolved from struggling with basic comprehension in the GPT-3.5 era to reaching the level of top-tier university students with GPT-5. This shift was more than technical progress.

For Korean users, AI stopped feeling like a clumsy translation tool. It became useful for writing, office work, studying, and small business operations. Natural Korean conversation, contextual understanding, and complex task handling expanded the user base almost overnight.

**The Unexpected Power of Pop Culture**

An unexpected cultural trigger also played a role. In April 2025, images generated in a so-called Ghibli-style using GPT-4o spread rapidly across Korean social media.

The appeal was immediate. No learning curve, instant results, and highly shareable visuals. According to the report, this moment marked more than a viral trend. It became a cultural gateway to AI.

Many first-time users who entered through image generation soon moved on to writing, translation, search, and learning tools. Policy and technology built the foundation. Popular culture lit the fuse.

**The U.S. Leads in Tech, Not in Usage**

The report also reveals an interesting contrast. While the United States remains the global leader in AI infrastructure and model development, it ranked only 24th in AI usage by population.

Korea, despite its smaller market size, surged ahead in adoption rates. Microsoft notes that technological leadership does not automatically translate into mass usage. Korea’s case shows how policy alignment, language optimization, and consumer-friendly services can accelerate AI diffusion across society.

**The Next Challenge: Closing the Gap**

The report ends with a warning. As AI usage expands globally, the gap between advanced economies and developing regions is widening. Countries with strong digital foundations, like Korea, continue to pull ahead, while others struggle with basic access.

Korea’s experience offers a broader lesson. AI adoption is not just a technology issue. It is a question of social design. When policy, language, culture, and user experience align, AI becomes a tool for everyone.

Korea’s rapid rise is not merely a jump in rankings. It is a live experiment in how AI can move from innovation to infrastructure on a national scale.

Detailed country data and full global analysis are available in Microsoft’s original report.
