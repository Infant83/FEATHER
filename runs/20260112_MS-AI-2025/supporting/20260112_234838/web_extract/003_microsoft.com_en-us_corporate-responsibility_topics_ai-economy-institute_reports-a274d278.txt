Executive summary
-----------------

Global adoption of artificial intelligence continued to rise in the second half of 2025, increasing by 1.2 percentage points compared to the first half of the year, with roughly one in six people worldwide now using generative AI tools,remarkable progress for a technology that only recently entered mainstream use.

To track this trend, we measure AI diffusion as the share of people worldwide who have used a generative AI product during the reported period. This measure is derived from aggregated and anonymized Microsoft telemetry and then adjusted to reflect differences in OS and device-market share, internet penetration, and country population.Additional details on the methodology are available in our AI Diffusion technical paper.[1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/topics/ai-economy-institute/reports/global-ai-adoption-2025/#fn:1)

No single metric is perfect, and this one is no exception. Through the Microsoft AI Economy Institute, we continue to refine how we measure AI diffusion globally, including how adoption varies across countries in ways that best advance priorities such as scientific discovery and productivity gains. For this report, we rely on the strongest cross-country measure available today, and we expect to complement it over time with additional indicators as they emerge and mature.

Despite progress in AI adoption,the data shows a widening divide: adoption in the Global North grew nearly twice as fast as in the Global South. As a result, 24.7 percent of the working age population in the Global North is now using these tools, compared to only 14.1 percent in the Global South.

### AI Diffusion by Economy H2 2025

![Image 5: A table showing the change in AI diffusion in the Global North, Global South, and the world from the first to second half of 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/table1-1-1-1024x213.png)
Countries that have invested early in digital infrastructure, AI skilling, and government adoption, such as the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Norway, Ireland, France, and Spain, continue to lead. The UAE extended its lead as the #1 ranked country, with 64.0 percent of the working age population using AI at the end of 2025, compared to 59.4 percent earlier in the year. The UAE has opened a lead of more than three percentage points over Singapore, which continues in second place with 60.9 percent adoption.

### AI Diffusion by Economy H2 2025

![Image 6: A world map showing the percentage of AI user share by country.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig2-1.png)
The second half of the year in the United States shows that leadership in innovation and infrastructure, while critical, does not by themselves lead to broad AI adoption. The U.S.leads in both AI infrastructure and frontier model development, but it fell from 23rd to 24th place in AI usage among the working age population, with a 28.3 percent usage rate. It lags far behind smaller, more highly digitized and AI-focused economies.

South Korea stands out as the clearest end-of-year success story. It surged seven spots in the global rankings, climbing from 25th to 18th, driven by government policies, improved frontier model capabilities in the Korean language, and consumer-facing features that resonated with the population. Generative AI is now used in schools, workplaces, and public services, and South Korea has become one of ChatGPT’s fastest-growing markets, leading OpenAI to open an office in Seoul.

### AI Diffusion Over Time by Country

![Image 7: A chart showing the rise in AI diffusion in thirty countries from the first to second half of 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig1-2-847x1024.png)
A parallel development reshaping the global landscape in 2025 was the rapid rise of DeepSeek, an open-source AI platform that has gained significant traction in markets long underserved by traditional providers. By releasing its model under an open-source MIT license and offering a completely free chatbot, DeepSeek removed both financial and technical barriers that limit access to advanced AI. Its strongest adoption, not surprisingly has emerged across China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Belarus. But perhaps even more notable is DeepSeek’s surging popularity across Africa, where it is aided by strategic promotion and partnerships with firms such as Huawei. [3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/topics/ai-economy-institute/reports/global-ai-adoption-2025/#fn:3)

This rapid evolution underscores an increasingly important dimension of AI competition between the United States and China, involving a race to promote adoption of their respective national models. DeepSeek’s success reflects growing Chinese momentum across Africa, a trend that may continue to accelerate in 2026. DeepSeek’s ascent also underscores a broader truth: the global diffusion of AI is influenced by accessibility factors, and the next wave of users may come from communities that have historically had limited access to technological progress. The challenge ahead is ensuring that innovation spreads in ways that help narrow divides rather than deepen them.

Changes in the second half of 2025
----------------------------------

New data from the second half of 2025 shows the world is using artificial intelligence at record levels, but it also reveals a widening divide. Global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3 percent of the world’s population, up from 15.1 percent in the first half of 2025, a meaningful gain for technologies still in their early years. Today,roughly one in six people are using AI to learn, work, or solve problems.

Yet this progress is uneven. Adoption in the Global North grew almost twice as fast as in the Global South, widening the gap from 9.8 to 10.6 percentage points. In short, AI’s benefits are expanding, but they are not expanding equally.

### AI User Share in the Global South and Global North

![Image 8: A bar chart showing the percentage of AI users in the Global South and Global North in the first and second half of 2025.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig3-2-1024x548.png)
When looking at the economies driving the fastest gains, the imbalance becomes even clearer. Of the ten countries with the largest increases in AI adoption share,all are high-income economies. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates stand out, each posting growth rates above four percentage points,underscoring how concentrated recent momentum has been among already AI-established economies.

### AI Adoption Share Over Time

![Image 9: A table showing the change in AI adoption share in the ten countries with highest share from the first to second half of 2025.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/table2-1-1024x565.png)
Among the top 30 countries, the overall rankings remained steady. Nations that have invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure continue to lead. The United Arab Emirates and Singapore again hold the top two positions, followed by Norway, Ireland, France, and Spain. Most other countries shifte
