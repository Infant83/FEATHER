Despite AI’s promise to accelerate different industries, the global south still lags in implementation. In December, I spent a week in my hometown in Zimbabwe and I suggested someone use ChatGPT for a question they had. To my surprise, they had never heard about ChatGPT! This is someone I grew up with who I would assume is tech saavy and connected online. With my passion for the continent and what AI can unlock, that deeply disturbed me. The risk of the global south missing out on leveraging this technology is real and I see it more now being based in London with access to what is happening at the frontier. Microsoft highlights this in their just published “Global AI Adoption in 2025—A Widening Digital Divide” report. Quote: “Despite progress in AI adoption, the data shows a widening divide: adoption in the Global North grew nearly twice as fast as in the Global South. As a result, 24.7 percent of the working age population in the Global North is now using these tools, compared to only 14.1 percent in the Global South.” Africa, there is a lot of work to do.

AI awareness and adoption are still uneven despite rapid global progress. Access, education, and local enablement are key to closing this gap

  The latest Global AI Adoption 2025 report from Microsoft shows incredible progress for some, one in six people worldwide now use generative AI. But here’s the challenge: adoption in the Global North is nearly twice as fast as in the Global South, creating a widening digital divide. Promoting AI diffusion isn’t just about technology, it’s about closing gaps, driving productivity, and ensuring inclusive access. Countries investing in digital infrastructure, AI education, and open innovation are leading the way. The next wave of innovation must benefit more people, in more places, not fewer.

  AI adoption is no longer about experimentation — it’s about economic impact. The newly released Global AI Adoption Report 2025 from Microsoft’s AI Economy Institute highlights a clear shift: organizations that move from pilots to scaled, operational AI are seeing measurable productivity gains and revenue impact. A few insights that stood out to me: - AI leaders are embedding AI into core workflows, not treating it as a side project - Talent, data readiness, and responsible AI governance are now growth enablers, not blockers - Regions that invest early in AI skilling and partner ecosystems are pulling ahead faster For me, this reinforces what we’re seeing across Asia & ASEAN — the opportunity is less about whether to adopt AI, and more about how fast enterprises and partners can convert AI intent into real business outcomes. The next frontier isn’t just AI adoption. It’s AI at scale, delivered responsibly, through strong platforms, skilled people, and trusted ecosystems. 🔗 Global AI Adoption Report 2025: [https://lnkd.in/g9bKF3sG](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fg9bKF3sG&urlhash=oMBh&trk=public_post-text) [#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=public_post-text) [#ArtificialIntelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fartificialintelligence&trk=public_post-text) [#AIEconomy](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faieconomy&trk=public_post-text) [#DigitalTransformation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdigitaltransformation&trk=public_post-text) [#CloudAndAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcloudandai&trk=public_post-text) [#ResponsibleAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fresponsibleai&trk=public_post-text) [#Productivity](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fproductivity&trk=public_post-text) [#ASEAN](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fasean&trk=public_post-text) [#Asia](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fasia&trk=public_post-text)

  AI adoption surged globally in 2025—but the year also exposed a growing digital divide. According to Microsoft’s latest AI Diffusion insights, roughly 1 in 6 people worldwide now use generative AI tools, marking one of the fastest technology adoption curves in history. Yet progress remains uneven: AI use in the Global North is nearly double that of the Global South, driven largely by differences in digital infrastructure, connectivity, and skilling. Countries like the UAE (64%), Singapore (60.9%), Norway, Ireland, and France continue to lead thanks to early investments in cloud, data centers, and national AI strategies. Meanwhile, adoption in emerging markets is rising more slowly despite strong interest—highlighting the urgent need for targeted investments that expand access and opportunity. As AI becomes a foundational technology for productivity, scientific discovery, and economic growth, 2025 made one thing clear: closing the AI access gap is just as important as accelerating innovation. 📘 Read the full "Microsoft On the Issues" blog for deeper insights: [https://lnkd.in/gqJzBwbE](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgqJzBwbE&urlhash=6x1W&trk=public_post-text)

  As we enter 2026, this new analysis on Global AI Adoption in 2025 underscores just how quickly AI has moved from experimentation to true business transformation. What stands out most is the shift from potential to productivity. Organizations across every industry—and in every region—are no longer asking “Should we use AI?” but “How fast can we scale it responsibly?” At Microsoft, we continue to see three themes accelerating that momentum: 🔹 AI as an economic driver: Companies are reporting measurable impact—faster decision‑making, higher automation, and meaningful gains in employee productivity. 🔹 A new skills imperative: Workforce readiness is becoming the new competitive divide. The investments businesses make today in upskilling will define their trajectory for the next decade. 🔹 Responsible AI as a foundation for trust: Adoption isn’t just about capability; it's about governance, safety, and accountability at scale. The past year has validated something important: AI isn’t simply a technology shift, it’s an operational shift—and a cultural one. The organizations that embrace both will lead the next wave of innovation. A great read for anyone shaping their 2026 strategy. 👇
