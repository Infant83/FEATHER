Vision-Language Modeling Meets Remote Sensing:
Models, Datasets and Perspectives
Xingxing Weng, Chao Pang, and Gui-Song Xia
Abstract—Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge
the information gap between images and natural language.
Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on massive image-
text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in
the remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The
resulting models benefit from the absorption of extensive general
knowledge and demonstrate strong performance across a variety
of remote sensing data analysis tasks. Moreover, they are capable
of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this
paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with
a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in
VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover
a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning,
visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image genera-
tion. For each category, we detail the commonly used network
architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a
thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models
and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM,
architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities
in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation
models with their representative downstream applications. Third,
we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning,
and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction method-
ologies (including image sources and caption generation) and
key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally, we
conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future
research directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague
requirement comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability,
continually scalable model capabilities, and large-scale datasets
featuring richer modalities and greater challenges.

I. INTRODUCTION

ISION-language modeling (VLM) in remote sensing,
aiming to bridge the information gap between remote
sensing images and natural language, facilitates a deeper
understanding of remote sensing scene semantics like the
attributes of ground objects and their relationship, and enables
more natural human interaction with intelligent remote sensing
data analysis models or methods [17], [164]. Since the intro-
duction of remote sensing tasks such as image captioning [62],
visual question answering [54], text-image (or image-text)
retrieval [166], and text-based image generation [165], VLM
in remote sensing has achieved significant success, driven by
advancements in deep learning.

Fig. 1. The number of publications on visual-language modeling in remote
sensing using the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.
Early works on VLM primarily emphasize the careful
design of model architectures, followed by supervised training
from scratch on small-scale datasets. For example, in image
captioning research, many efforts [167]–[170] have been made
to effectively combine convolutional neural networks (e.g.
VGG [171] and ResNet [172]) with sequential models (e.g.
LSTM [173] and Transformer [174]) before training on UCM-
captions [62] and Sydney-captions [62] datasets. Under this
classical construction paradigm, deep models often excel on
test datasets but struggle to perform satisfactorily in large-scale
deployments. Moreover, although these models are capable of
describing image content, they fall short when tasked with
answering questions about the images. In other words, they
struggle to accomplish related tasks, such as visual question
answering. The task-specific nature of these models seriously
limits their applicability across diverse scenarios.
Recently, a new paradigm of pre-training followed by fine-
tuning provides a promising solution to address the challenges
mentioned above. The core idea is to first pre-train a model
on massive image-text data, enabling it to capture general
knowledge that covers a wide range of visual and textual
concepts, along with their underlying correspondence. The
pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on task-specific training
data. The integration of general knowledge has been shown
to enhance the model’s generalization ability in a single
task [7], [8], while also making it more versatile and capable of
handling a variety of downstream tasks [1], [3]. Consequently,
vision-language modeling with this new paradigm has emerged
as a prominent research focus in the field of remote sensing.

Fig. 2. Overview of this survey.
To date, significant progress has been achieved, as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. This includes works based on 1) contrastive
learning [175], such as GeoRSCLIP [7], SkyCLIP [8] and
RemoteCLIP [2], which have driven substantial advancements
in various cross-modal tasks and zero-shot image understand-
ing tasks. 2) learning an implicit joint distribution between
text and images, like RS-SD [7], DiffusionSat [38] and CRS-
Diff [39], which allow for image generation from text prompts.
3) visual instruction tuning [201], such as GeoChat [3], LHRS-
Bot [9], and SkySenseGPT [11], which have demonstrated
improved performance, diverse capabilities, and conversational
interactions in remote sensing data analysis.
Despite these remarkable achievements, it is widely ac-
knowledged that VLM remains an open challenge. Indeed, ex-
isting works have not yet achieved the level of remote sensing
experts in processing remote sensing data. To provide clarity
and motivation for further advances in the research community,
several surveys have reviewed vision-language modeling in
remote sensing. For instance, Li et al. [17] summarize vision-
language models from an application perspective and suggest
potential research opportunities. However, due to time con-
straints, they primarily concentrate on vision-only foundation
models and early works. Zhou et al. [16] review recent devel-
opments but lack an in-depth analysis of key designs, which
is significant for inspiring future research. Moreover, datasets,
as a prerequisite of visual-language modeling research, have
not been given adequate attention in existing surveys.
In this work, we aim to provide a timely and comprehensive
review of the literature, with a focus on vision-language
modeling based on the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
in the field of remote sensing. Specifically, we cover: 1) a
taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing, detailing commonly
used network architectures and pre-training objectives for
each category; 2) the latest advancements in contrastive-based,
instruction-based, and generation-based vision-language mod-
eling in remote sensing, highlighting key designs and down-
stream applications; 3) progress in datasets for VLM pre-
training, fine-tuning, and evaluation; 4) several challenges and
potential research directions. Fig. 2 presents an overview of
this paper.
II. THE TAXONOMY OF VISUAL-LANGUAGE MODELING
IN REMOTE SENSING
Under the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, vision-
language modeling in remote sensing can be divided into
three distinct groups based on their strategies for bridging the
two modalities in the pre-training phase: contrastive learning,
visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image gener-
ation. In this section, we present commonly used network
architectures and pre-training objectives within each group.
Contrastive Learning: The motivation behind applying
contrastive learning to vision-language modeling is training a
model to map vision and language into a shared representation
space, where an image and its corresponding text share similar
representations while differing from other texts, which was
first implemented by the pioneering work CLIP [86] in the
field of computer vision. As illustrated in Fig.3 (a), CLIP uti-
lizes two independent encoders responsible for encoding visual
and textual information. Given a batch of N image-text pairs
{(xi, yi)}N
i=1, the embeddings extracted by the two encoders
followed by normalization are {eI
i , eT
i }N
i=1. To achieve the
similarity between visual and textual representations, CLIP is
trained to maximize the cosine similarity of the embeddings
of the ith image and the corresponding ith text (i ∈[N] with
[N] = {1, 2, . . . , N}), while minimizing the cosine similarity
of the embeddings of the ith image and jth text (i, j ∈[N],
i ̸= j). The loss is computed using InfoNCE [176] as follows:
LInfoNCE = −1

where sI
ij = S(eI

scores between the image and text embeddings, as com-
puted by the function S(e, e

Based on the strategies employed to bridge remote sensing images and natural language during the pre-training phase, vision-language modeling
(VLM) in remote sensing can be categorized into three groups: (a) contrastive learning, (b) visual instruction tuning, and (c) text-conditioned image generation.

The original CLIP model was trained on 400 million image-
text pairs collected from the Internet and has demonstrated
impressive results across various computer vision tasks [177]–
[179]. These advancements spark interest in extending its
capability to advance vision-language modeling in remote
sensing. Two primary lines of research have been actively
explored. The first, following the CLIP learning way, focuses
on pre-training foundation models that are task-agnostic but
specifically adapted for remote sensing domain. This includes
efforts such as constructing large-scale image-text datasets [7],
[8] and developing novel pre-training objectives [4], [26]. The
second line explores effective adaptation of pre-trained CLIP
models toward diverse downstream tasks, including image
captioning [14], [19], zero-shot scene classification [20], [25],
image-text retrieval [15], [31], etc.
Visual Instruction Tuning: Optimizing a model from
scratch for image-text alignment is extremely resource-
intensive due to the need for vast amounts of data and
computational power. Fortunately, many pre-trained vision
encoders and language models have been released. Pre-trained
vision encoders can provide high-quality visual representa-
tions, while pre-trained language models, particularly large
language models (LLMs), demonstrate advanced language un-
derstanding capabilities. As a result, recent works increasingly
leverage these models to achieve image-text alignment through
visual instruction tuning, as introduced by LLaVA [201] and
MiniGPT-4 [129]. Fig.3 (b) illustrates a network architecture
for this type of work, consisting of three key components: a
pre-trained vision encoder, a connector, and a large language
model. Specifically, the vision encoder compresses remote
sensing images into compact visual representations, while the
connector maps image embeddings into the word embedding
space of the LLM. The LLM then receives both visual
information and language instructions to perform reasoning
tasks. Different from CLIP, which directly takes images and
corresponding texts as input, this type of work preprocesses
image-text pairs to instruction-following data. In this setup,
each image is accompanied by a question, or language in-
struction, requiring the LLM to describe the image, while the
corresponding text serves as the ground truth for the LLM’s
predictions. Denote a batch of instruction-following data as
{(xi, qi, yi)}N
i=1, where qi is the question associated with the
ith image. The pre-training objective is defined as:
LVIT = −1
N
N
X
i=1
1
Li
Li
X
j=1
log P(wj|xi, qi, yi,<j),
(2)
where Li is the length of the caption yi = {w1, w2, . . . , wLi},
yi,<j denotes the masked sequence that contain only the
first j −1 words, and P(wj|xi, qi, yi,<j) is the conditional
probability of generating the caption word wj given the image
xi, question qi and the previous words yi,<j in the caption.
During pre-training, the vision encoder and large language
model are typically kept frozen, with only the parameters of
the connector being trainable.
In [129], [201], the authors demonstrated that pre-training
with visual instruction tuning can align vision and language
representations while preserving extensive knowledge. Since
then, advances have been made by modifying network ar-
chitectures and creating high-quality pre-training datasets [9],
[202]. In addition to improving alignment, another line of re-
search focuses on supervised fine-tuning, aiming to enable the
model to perform a variety of remote sensing image analysis
tasks and interact with users in a conversational manner. This
includes efforts to generate task-specific instruction-following
data [3], [5], [11], design novel training strategies [136], [202],
and incorporate cutting-edge vision encoders [136].
Text-Conditioned Image Generation: Taking advantage
of the advances in conditional image generation, a group of
works [7], [38], [39] uses off-the-shelf generative models,
primarily Stable Diffusion [203], to generate remote sensing
images given text prompts, which essentially learns an im-
plicit joint distribution between images and texts. As illus-
trated in Fig.3 (c), their network architecture comprises three
main components: a text encoder, a variational autoencoder
(VAE) [204], and a denoising U-Net. During training, the VAE
encoder first transforms an image into a latent representation
z0. Gaussian noise ϵ is then added to this latent representation
at different timesteps t, resulting in zt = √¯αtz0 + √1 −¯αtϵ,
where ¯αt is a time-dependent scaling factor. Next, the con-
ditioning representation c, extracted from the text encoder,
is provided as input alongside zt to the denoising U-Net,
which predicts the noise added at timestep t. Finally, the
VAE decoder upsamples the denoised latent representation to
reconstruct the input image. Based on image-text pairs, the
training objective is defined as:
LLDM = Ez0,c,ϵ,t

∥ϵ −ϵθ(zt, t, c)∥2

where ϵθ(zt, t, c) is the model’s predicted noise, parameter-
ized by θ. The application of diffusion models in remote
sensing has shown rapid development, encompassing areas
such as remote sensing image generation, enhancement, and
interpretation [205]. As this paper focuses on vision-language
modeling using diffusion models, we do not attempt to cover
every instance of their application in remote sensing tasks.
Instead, we specifically highlight works that integrate text
conditions with diffusion models. For a more comprehensive
overview of the advancements in diffusion models for remote
sensing, please refer to [205].
Based on the fundamental principles outlined above, two
major research groups have emerged. The first group aims
to develop generative foundation models for various remote
sensing images, including satellite [38], aerial [206], hyper-
spectral [207], and multi-resolution images [208]. The second
group, in contrast, extends text-conditioned diffusion models
to specific remote sensing tasks, such as image or change
captioning [150], [154], pansharpening [148] and zero-shot
target recognition [155].
III. CONTRASTIVE-BASED VISION-LANGUAGE MODELING
Most existing works on VLM fall into the group of em-
ploying contrastive learning. As mentioned previously, there
are two main research directions being actively investigated,
namely foundation model construction and effective adapta-
tion. Specifically, foundation model construction concerns the
large domain gap between natural and remote sensing images,
aiming to learn visual representations with rich remote sensing
scene semantics and well-aligned with textual representations.
On the other hand, effective adaptation answers the question
of how to leverage pre-trained CLIP models for specific
remote sensing tasks. In the following sections, we analyze
the existing works from these two directions.
A. Foundation Model Construction
Table I summarizes contrastive-based vision-language mod-
els in remote sensing. To build foundation models, three key
components need to be carefully designed: training datasets,
pre-training objectives, and encoder architectures.
Training Datasets: Large-scale image-text datasets form
the basis for constructing foundation models. Ready-made
image-text datasets in remote sensing, e.g. UCM-captions
and Sydney-captions, suffer from limited data volume and
insufficient image diversity, rendering them inadequate for
pre-training models to capture general knowledge of the
domain. Recognizing the availability of numerous remote
sensing image datasets, [7] and [2] use open-source datasets
as the image source and develop image captioning methods to
generate corresponding textual descriptions. Notably, [7] filter
11 commonly-used image-text datasets using RS-related key-
words and caption 3 large-scale RS image datasets (Million-
AID [100], fMoW [117], and BigEarthNet [113]) with the
aid of the tuned BLIP2 model [118], resulting in the RS5M
dataset, which contains over 5 million image-text pairs. Off-
the-shelf vision-language models are indeed powerful tools for
building large-scale image-text datasets due to their availability
and ease of use, but ensuring captioning accuracy remains a
significant challenge. To address this, [2] proposes a rule-based
method called mask-to-box and box-to-caption, which converts
pixel-wise or bounding box annotations into natural language
captions. Another concern is that the semantic diversity of
the generated captions is constrained by the limited number
of predefined classes in open-source remote sensing image


===== PAGE 5 =====

datasets. Given this, Wang et al. [8] attempt to leverage rich
semantic information contained in OpenStreetMap, allowing
the textual descriptions to encompass not only a wide variety
of object categories but also fine-grained subcategories and
object attributes. Similar to [2], captions are assembled from
object tags following predefined rules.
Pre-training Objectives: Instead of creating large-scale
datasets, several works [4], [18], [26] explore new training
objectives to facilitate model pre-training with few remote
sensing image-text pairs. For instance, S-CLIP [18] introduces
caption-level and keyword-level pseudo labels to fine-tune the
original CLIP model on massive unpaired remote sensing im-
ages alongside a few image-text pairs. Denote a large number
of unpaired images as {ui}M
i=1 (M ≫N). The caption-level
pseudo-label qc
i ∈RN is based on the assumption that the
semantics of an unpaired image ui can be represented as a
combination of those of paired images. Thus, qc
i represents a
probability distribution over the captions of N paired images,
derived from the relationships between unpaired and paired
images, which are formulated as an optimal transport problem.
The keyword-level pseudo label qk
i
∈RK relies on the
assumption that ui shares keywords with visually similar
images, representing the similarity between the embeddings of
ui and the keywords (drawn from the nearest paired image)
{kj}K
j=1. The loss functions for two pseudo-labels are defined
as:
Lcaption = −1
M
M
X
i=1
N
X
j=1
qc
ij log στ(sU
ij, {sU
il}N

Lkeyword = −1

M
X
i=1
K
X
j=1
qk
ij log στ(sU
ij, {sU
il}K
l=1).
(5)
In Eq.(4), sU
il = S(eU
i , eT
l ) refers to the similarity score of the
unpaired image embedding eU
i and the caption embedding eT
l
of the paired image. Meanwhile, in Eq.(5), sU
il = S(eU
i , ek
l )
denotes the similarity score between eU
i
and the keyword
embedding ek
l . Since few image-text pairs are involved in the
fine-tuning process, the overall training objective also includes
the InfoNCE loss, as shown in Eq.(6).
LS−CLIP = LInfoNCE + 1
2(Lcaption + Lkeyword).
(6)
With a similar training data setup consisting of massive
unpaired images and texts {ui, vi}M
i=1 and limited image-text
pairs {(xi, yi)}N
i=1, Set-CLIP [26] transforms the represen-
tation alignment between images and texts into a manifold
matching problem, developing a multi-kernel maximum mean
discrepancy loss LMK−MMD and a semantic density distri-
bution loss LSDD. The loss LMK−MMD constrains the con-
sistency of whole representation distributions of images and
texts, thereby achieving macro-level alignment, as formulated
in Eq.(7).
LMK−MMD =

where ϕ(·) is a linear combination of Gaussian and Polynomial
kernel functions, used to map image and text embeddings eI

Meanwhile, the loss LSDD refines the alignment between
the two modalities by ensuring that their probability density
distributions remain similar in the representation space. It can
be formulated as:
LSDD = 1
2(Γ(I, T) + Γ(T, I)),
(8)

refer to embedding
distributions of images and texts, respectively. Γ(·, ·) repre-
sents the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the

with Γ(T, I) defined similarly by swapping the roles of I and
T. Here, κ(·, ·) is an exponential probability density function
that estimates the density value for each embedding in the
corresponding distribution. Additionally, the self-supervised
contrastive loss LSSL is introduced to obtain robust feature

(10)
where ei is an embedding, and e+
i
is the representation of
the positive sample generated by augmentation techniques.
Ultimately, the overall training objective is formulated as:
LSet−CLIP = αLInfoNCE + µLSSL + δLMK−MMD + ηLSDD,
(11)
where α, µ, δ and η are tunable hyperparameters to balance
the loss terms.
Even a small set of image-text pairs requires expert knowl-
edge to craft textual descriptions. To avoid textual annotations
entirely, GRAFT [4] proposes utilizing co-located ground
images as the bridge between satellite images and language. In
doing so, a dataset of two million ground-satellite image pairs,
denoted as {xi, {gij}Ni
j=1}N
i=1, is collected to support model
training. Building on this, a feature extractor is designed to
map satellite images to the representation space of the CLIP
model, which was trained on internet image-text pairs. Since
a satellite image xi can cover a large ground area and thus be
associated with multiple ground images {gij}Ni
j=1, the extractor
is optimized using the following loss:
LGRAFT = −1

exp(S(eI

b=1 exp(S(eI
i ,eG
ab)/τ),
(12)
where eG
ij is the embedding of the jth ground image corre-
sponding to the ith satellite image. This loss focuses solely on
aligning image-level representations between the two types of
images while ignoring the fact that a ground image gij can be
mapped to a specific pixel location pij in the corresponding
satellite image xi. Thus, GRAFT trains the feature extractor
with an additional pixel-level contrastive loss as follows:
LGRAFT = −1

where eP

Encoder Architectures: Unlike natural images, where
corresponding textual information typically describes the im-
age content, the textual information for remote sensing images
can be represented by their geographic coordinates (longitude
and latitude), which are beneficial for tasks such as scene
classification and object recognition [117]. Therefore, some
works propose aligning representations from remote sensing
images and their geographic coordinates, with particular at-
tention given to the choice of location encoders [35]–[37].
A location encoder generally consists of a nonparametric
functional positional encoding combined with a small neu-
ral network. In CSP [37], an existing 2D location encoder,
namely Space2Vec’s grid proposed in [181], is utilized. This
encoder maps image coordinates into high-dimensional rep-
resentations using sinusoid transforms for position encoding,
followed by fully connected ReLU layers. GeoCLIP [36],
on the other hand, first applies equal earth projection to the
image coordinates to reduce distortions inherent in standard
geographic coordinate systems. It then adopts random Fourier
features [185] to capture high-frequency details, varying the
frequency to construct hierarchical representations. These hier-
archical representations are processed through separate multi-
layer perceptions (MLPs), followed by element-wise addition,
resulting in a joint representation. This design enables the
location encoder to effectively capture features of a specific
location across multiple scales. In SatCLIP [35], the authors
use a location encoder that combines spherical harmonics
basis functions with sinusoidal representation networks to map
geographic coordinates into latent representations [183].
In addition to adapting encoders for different types of
textual information, another purpose of adjusting encoders
is to improve the representations of visual concepts. Remote
sensing images typically cover a large field of view and in-
clude a variety of objects. However, the corresponding textual
descriptions often center on specific objects of interest and
their relationships. Semantic noise, such as irrelevant objects
and background, can interfere with the representation of key
content in images, thereby obstructing the alignment between
image and text representations. In [133], this problem is
addressed by using prior knowledge of remote sensing scenes
to instruct the pre-trained model in filtering out semantic
noise before calculating the similarity between image and
text embeddings. This is practically achieved by adding an
instruction encoder and a transformer encoder layer on top of
the vision encoder. The instruction encoder, pre-trained on the
scene classification dataset AID [102], generates instruction
embeddings, which are used to filter image embeddings via a
soft belief strategy. The filtered embeddings are then activated
using instruction information through the transformer encoder
layer, producing relevant image embeddings for subsequent
alignment.
Performance Evaluation: Zero-shot scene classification
and image-text retrieval are commonly used tasks to assess
foundation models’ capabilities to capture a wide range of
visual and textual concepts, along with their correspondence.
Table II lists the performance of contrastive-based vision-
language foundation models on these two tasks. Note that it
shows the best model performance in the original papers. For
zero-shot scene classification, three conclusions can be drawn:
1) AID [102] is the most widely used dataset for evaluation,
with RemoteCLIP achieving the best accuracy of 87.9%; 2)
Using the same vision encoder (ViT-L/14), SkyCLIP, which
is pre-trained on images collected from Google Earth, outper-
forms RemoteCLIP only on PatternNet [95], a dataset sourced
from Google Earth; 3) Comparing models pre-trained on
limited image-text pairs (i.e. S-CLIP, SetCLIP, and GRAFT)
with RemoteCLIP, their performance is somewhat compara-
ble, showing the importance of exploring data-effective pre-
training. For cross-modal retrieval, PIR-CLIP achieves state-
of-the-art performance on RSICD [60] and RSITMD [61].
In comparison, S-CLIP and SetCLIP perform significantly
worse, with a performance gap exceeding 20%. This suggests
that existing foundation models pre-trained on limited image-
text pairs are capable of acquiring general visual and textual
concepts but may face challenges in learning the relationships
between them.
B. Effective Adaptation Methods
Inspired by the outstanding performance of foundation
models, numerous methods have been developed to effectively
adapt pre-trained models for specific remote sensing tasks,
including image captioning, cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot
classification, dense prediction, etc. This section presents the
development of adaptation methods within the context of
different downstream tasks.
Image Captioning: aims to describe the content of a
given image using natural language. Vision-language foun-
dation models are well-suited for this task, as they align
image and text representations. One can use the vision encoder
of these models to extract representations of image content,
which prepares the input for language models to generate
captions [19], [29], [43]. Commonly used vision encoders for
remote sensing image captioning are from CLIP, while lan-
guage models for this task include GPT-2 [200], BERT [198],
and OPT [197]. To improve caption accuracy, a few works are
devoted to enhancing models’ visual representation capabili-
ties or further aligning images and texts.
For
example,

representation
enhancement,
VLCA [29] introduces external attention [199] to capture
potential correlations between different images, improving
visual representations. MVP [19] fuses visual representations
from pre-trained vision-language models and pre-trained
vision models through stacked transformer encoders. It
also leverages CLIP’s vision encoder, followed by adaptive
average pooling layers, to generate visual prefixes, which are
concatenated with token embeddings. A BERT-based caption
generator is subsequently developed to combine the fused
visual representations and concatenated embeddings, enabling
the generation of accurate captions. In contrast, BITA [43]
focuses on improving the alignment of images and texts in the
remote sensing domain by introducing an interactive Fourier
transformer. In this design, learnable visual prompts are fed to
the Fourier layer and interact with image embeddings from a
pre-trained vision encoder, capturing the most relevant visual
representations. Through contrastive learning, these visual

RESISC is short for NWPU-RESISC45 [53]. Mean refers to the mean recall averaged of recall@1 (R@1), recall@5 (R@5) and recall@10 (R@10). † indicates
that the training data corresponding to the test dataset was not used to pre-train the model.
representations are aligned with textual representations, also
extracted by the Fourier-based transformer. The interactive
Fourier transformer then connects the frozen vision encoder
with the frozen language model, leveraging the language
model’s generation and reasoning capabilities.
Beyond improving caption accuracy, generating detailed
captions has also been explored [135], [297]. In [135], a
two-stage instruction fine-tuning is proposed for the vision-
to-language mapping layer to generate geographically detailed
captions. The first stage, guided by the instruction “[region]
Based on the provided region of the remote sensing image,
describe the basic attributes of the main objects in that region.”,
aligns geographic object regions with their attribute descrip-
tions. The second stage, guided by the instruction “[image]
Please provide a detailed description of this image.”, focuses
on understanding the spatial distribution of geographic objects
within images. In [297], image captioning is defined as the
aggregation of information from multi-turn dialogues, where
each turn serves to query the image content. In each turn,
CLIP’s vision encoder extracts image features, which are then
input into an auto-regressive language model [200] along
with previous questions, answers, and the current question
to generate the response. After several dialogue turns, GPT-
3 [298] summarizes the dialogue information to produce an
enriched textual image description.
Unlike previous works that caption a single image, Prompt-
CC [42] utilizes pre-trained models to describe differences
between bi-temporal images, a task known as change caption-
ing. Based on bit-temporal visual representations from CLIP,
Prompt-CC introduces an image-level classifier to detect the
presence of changes, and a feature-level encoder to extract
discriminative features that identify the specific changes.
Cross-Modal Retrieval: is the task of retrieving data
from one modality by using queries from another modality.
Based on vision-language foundation models, there is ongoing
research that explores retrieval between images and text [31],
[131], [134], as well as between images captured with different
imaging parameters [15]. Image-text retrieval involves the
challenges of finding textual descriptions that correspond to
given image queries and vice versa. Taking advantage of ad-
vances in vision-language foundation models, existing works
use pre-trained encoders to encode images and text separately,
mapping them into a shared representation space for simi-
larity measurement. Typically, CISEN [31] adopts encoders
from CLIP and GeoRSCLIP as the backbone for its retrieval
network. Given the abundance of objects in remote sensing
images, CISEN is trained in two stages to enhance visual
representation. In the first stage, an image adapter [188] is
trained to map global visual features into textual-like features.
In the second stage, a feature pyramid network is used to
integrate the textual-like features into local visual features,
which are then utilized to enrich global visual features. Rather
than focusing on effective representation, KTIR [131] aims to
improve alignment by explicitly incorporating knowledge into
text features. The knowledge is derived from textual informa-
tion using off-the-shelf knowledge sources like RSKG [190]
and ConceptNet [189]. Once converted to knowledge sen-
tences, the knowledge is processed by the text encoder to
extract knowledge features, which are then fused with text
features via a single cross-attention layer.
Image-image retrieval involves searching for relevant im-
ages across different imaging parameters, such as matching
RGB images with multispectral images, as explored in [15].
The authors use a pre-trained CLIP text encoder as the classi-
fication head, and fine-tune the CLIP vision encoder alongside
a newly added multispectral-specific encoder. The training is
conducted in stages: first, the CLIP vision encoder is fine-
tuned on RGB images composited from multispectral images,
followed by fine-tuning the new encoder on multispectral
images. This encoder is guided to produce discriminative
representations that can achieve accurate image classification,
while ensuring its representations are similar to those of RGB

images extracted by the CLIP vision encoder.
Considering the complexity of Earth’s surface, single-
modality queries, such as text queries, require users to fully
articulate their needs to pinpoint relevant images. This raises
the barrier to using retrieval models. To address this issue,
Psomas et al. [134] introduce the composed-to-image retrieval
task, which searches for remote sensing images based on a
composed query of image and text. The retrieved images share
the same scene or object category as the image query and
reflect the attribute defined by the text query. To achieve this,
the authors in [134] propose calculating similarity scores for
the image and text query separately, then normalizing and
combining these scores using a convex combination controlled
by a weighting parameter λ, which adjusts the contribution of
each modality. As shown in Fig. 4, when λ = 0, composed-to-
image retrieval simplifies to image-to-image retrieval, while at
λ = 1, it simplifies to text-to-image retrieval.
Zero-shot Scene Classification: challenges models to
identify remote sensing images from scene categories that
were not seen during training. The idea of applying vision-
language foundation models to this task is straightforward:
since these models align images and texts, zero-shot scene
classification can be achieved by comparing image embed-
dings with text embeddings extracted by the text encoder,

which takes as input textual descriptions specifying the unseen
classes. By default, these descriptions follow the format “a
photo of a [CLASS].”, where the class token is replaced
by the specific class name, such as “farmland”, “forest” or
“playground”. The input text, also known as prompt, plays a
crucial role in the performance of foundation models on down-
stream tasks. As a result, several works [14], [20] pay attention
to prompt tuning and suggest adding task-relevant context
words to improve performance. An example is provided by
[20], where the authors replace “photo” with terms such as
“remote sensing image”, “top view image”, “satellite image”
and “scene”. This slight modification results in more than a
5% increase in the accuracy of the CLIP model with the ViT-

B/32 vision encoder on UCM dataset [70]. However, as noted
in other experiments from [20], prompts subjected to extensive
tuning are not guaranteed to be optimal for the task and may
not be suitable for other test datasets. To avoid manual prompt
tuning, Lan et al. [153] model context words in a prompt as
learnable vectors, which are combined with the class token
embeddings before being input to the text encoder. Moreover,
the class token embeddings for each category are organized
across multiple levels of granularity, taking the form: “a
photo of a ship, the primary type is [CLASS1], secondary
type is [CLASS2], final type is [CLASS3].”, aimed at the
task of few-shot fine-grained ship classification. Compared
to hand-crafted prompts, these hierarchical, learnable prompts
incorporate richer task-specific knowledge.
Most works employ and freeze pre-trained CLIP models.
However, due to the significant domain gap between web
images and remote sensing images, their performance tends
to be limited. To mitigate this, one can inject remote sensing
domain priors into the vision encoder [153], or fine-tune the
entire model using pseudo labeling techniques [14]. Typically,
Lan et al. [153] introduce a lightweight network that is trained
on data from seen classes to capture the domain prior. This
prior is then combined with image embeddings output by the
vision encoder, allowing the pre-trained model to adapt better.
On the other hand, RS-CLIP [14] leverages the strong trans-
ferability of the pre-trained model to automatically generate
pseudo labels from unlabeled images, which are used to fine-
tune the model. Additionally, a curriculum learning strategy is
developed to gradually select more pseudo-labeled images for
model training in multiple rounds, further boosting the model’s
performance in zero-shot scene classification.
In addition to comparing the similarity between embeddings
of images and unseen-class texts, DSVA [25] introduces a
solution that uses pre-trained models to annotate attributes for
each scene class, and predict scene categories by evaluating
the similarity between attribute values derived from image
embeddings and those associated with scene classes. For
automatic attribute annotation, textual descriptions have the
form of “This photo contains [ATTRIBUTE]”, where the
attribute token is replaced by specific attribute names, such
as “red”, “cement” or “rectangle”. Meanwhile, the attribute
value for each class is calculated by measuring the similarity
between embeddings of attribute text and images belonging to
that class.
Dense Prediction Tasks: such as semantic segmenta-
tion and change detection, which produce pixel-level pre-
dictions for input images, have recently benefited from the
application of vision-language foundation models. Typically,
Text2Seg [41] uses a CLIP model to classify category-agnostic
segmentation masks generated by the segment anything model
(SAM) [191], enabling zero-shot semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images. Lan et al. [40] instead modify the
CLIPSeg decoder [192] to receive joint image-text embeddings
from the CLIP model as input, producing a binary segmen-
tation mask. The decoder is composed of transformer blocks,
convolution layers, and linear interpolation layers.
Without the need for additional decoders or segmentation
models, one can perform an upsampling operation on image

embeddings from CLIP, and compare the similarity between
image patch embeddings and text embeddings to produce
segmentation results. However, empirical findings in [187]
suggest that for CLIP with a vision encoder based on ViT-
B/16, the image embeddings are downsampled to 1/16 of
the input image size, This downsampling leads to distorted
object shapes and poorly fitting boundaries in segmentation
masks. Furthermore, CLIP’s self-attention causes global infor-
mation from the class token embedding to be attached to the
patch embeddings, which significantly degrades performance
in semantic segmentation. To handle these issues, SegEarth-
OV [187] incorporates SimFeatUp on top of the CLIP vi-
sion encoder to restore lost spatial information in image
embeddings. Subsequently, subtraction operations are executed
between patch embeddings and the class token embeddings
before similarity measurement, alleviating global bias in patch
embeddings. In particular, SimFeatUp is a learnable upsampler
consisting of a single parameterized JBU operator. It is trained
with a frozen CLIP model, a learnable downsampler, and a
lightweight content retention network. The training objective
is to ensure that the image embeddings, after the up-down-
sampling process, remain similar to those from CLIP. Mean-
while, the image generated by the content retention network,
which takes the upsampled image embeddings as input, should
closely resemble the input image to CLIP.
When it comes to change detection, similar adaptation
strategies used in segmentation tasks, such as combining
SAM with CLIP and designing decoders, are applied. For
instance, in SCM [27], CLIP is applied after SAM to identify
objects of interest in bi-temporal images, helping to filter
out pseudo changes. In ChangeCLIP [13], CLIP is used
to construct and encode multi-modal input data for change
detection tasks, while a transformer-based decoder combines
bi-temporal vision-language features with image features to
produce change maps. To be specific, the authors pre-define 56
common land cover categories in remote sensing images and
use the CLIP model to identify bi-temporal images from these
categories. Each image is paired with textual descriptions of
the foreground and background, formatted as “remote sensing
image foreground objects, [Predict Classes]” and “remote
sensing image background objects”, respectively. This way
allows bi-temporal texts to highlight the changing object,
providing additional information for change detection.


===== PAGE 10 =====

Alternatively, only the vision encoders of foundation models
are adopted, as most existing datasets provide only bi-temporal
images for identifying changes. In BAN [28], the authors
introduce bridging modules to inject general knowledge ex-
tracted from the vision encoders of foundation models into
existing change detection models like BiT [193] and Change-
Former [194]. Since the input image sizes for foundation
models and change detection models may differ, and not
all general knowledge contributes to predicting changes, the
bridging modules are responsible for selecting, aligning, and
injecting this knowledge. As shown in Fig.5, these modules
consist of three main components: layer normalization and a
linear layer to mitigate the distribution inconsistency between
the image features from the two models, cross-attention to
obtain valuable information from general knowledge, and
bi-linear interpolation to solve the misalignment problem.
The bridging modules are placed between the two encoders,
executing multi-level knowledge injection.
Broader Scope of Application: In addition to remote
sensing tasks previously discussed, there are several emerging
applications of contrastive-based vision-language foundation
models, including:
(1) Visual Question Answering attempts to provide answers
to questions related to the content of images. In [23], CLIP
is used to extract both visual and textual representations from
images and questions. Two decoders, followed by two classi-
fiers, are then developed to capture the intradependencies and
interdependencies within and between these representations.
The final answer is determined by averaging the predictions
from both classifiers.
(2) Cloud Presence Detection involves identifying satellite
images that are affected by clouds. The authors in [21] explore
several strategies to adapt CLIP for this task: One approach,
similar to zero-shot scene classification [20], involves selects
prompts such as “This is a satellite image with clouds” and
“This is a satellite image with clear sky”, and then classifying
satellite images via similarity measurement. Another strategy
follows CoOp [195], combining learnable context with the
class token embeddings. Alternatively, the vision encoder can
be employed by itself, with a linear classifier added on top.
Unlike the first strategy, the other approaches necessitate
training for prompts or classifiers.
(3) Text-based Image Generation refers to the task of
creating images from textual descriptions, which can help
mitigate the issue of class imbalance commonly found in
remote sensing data. Typically, TGN [44] utilizes CLIP to
classify generated images, ensuring semantic class consistency
between input images and generated ones.
(4) Image Address Localization aims to predict the readable
textual address where an image was taken [196]. Different
from image geo-localization in [36], which predicts GPS
coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) from images, this task
outputs semantic address text such as “Grant Street, Down-
town”. Utilizing existing foundation models like CSP [37] and
GeoCLP [36], a viable solution is predicting GPS coordinates
with a foundation model and then converting them into read-
able addresses. However, this mapping from coordinates to
addresses often presents ambiguities. A recent work, Address-

CLIP [196], introduces a novel idea for performing image
address localization in an end-to-end manner. In particular,
AddressCLIP applies contrastive learning to align images
with scene captions and address texts. Furthermore, image-
geography matching is developed to bring features of geo-
graphically proximate images closer together while distancing
features of images that are far apart geographically. Fig.6

IV. INSTRUCTION-BASED VISION-LANGUAGE MODELING
Today, instruction-based vision-language modeling is ad-
vancing rapidly. Since 2023, over ten impressive vision-
language models have emerged, as shown in Table IV. They
are not only versatile, capable of performing a range of
remote sensing image analysis tasks, but also able to interact
with users in a conversational manner. This broadens the
accessibility of intelligent models beyond experts in remote
sensing, facilitating their widespread deployment and applica-
tion. This section presents critical developments in terms of
model architecture, and training strategy, model capability.
A. Model Architecture
As CLIP has been trained to align image and text repre-
sentations, most works [3], [9]–[11], [202] directly employ
its vision encoder. The commonly used large language mod-
els include the LLaMA family [57], [58] and its derivative
Vicuna family [47]. Developed by Meta, the first-generation
LLaMA [58] adopts transformer architectures ranging from
7B to 65B parameters, pre-trained on approximately 1.4
trillion tokens of publicly available text corpora. Despite its
smaller scale, LLaMA outperforms proprietary models like
GPT-3 [298]. Its successor, LLaMA 2 [57], introduces sig-
nificant improvements, including expanded pre-training data
(2 trillion tokens), architectural upgrades such as grouped-
query attention [299], and a scaled-up 70B-parameters variant.
Through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning
with human feedback, LLaMA 2 was further optimized for
dialogue, yielding the LLaMA 2-Chat series [57]. Parallel
to this development, the research community developed Vi-
cuna [47] by fine-tuning LLaMA models on 70K conversations
from ShareGPT. These models achieve more than 90% of
ChatGPT’s quality.
Regarding model architecture, existing works are devoted to
improving visual encoders to enhance visual perception, and

designing connectors to promote the alignment between the
two modalities. Specifically,
Vision Encoder: Through a mask image modeling pre-
text task, EVA [56] incorporates geometry and structure infor-
mation into CLIP’s visual representations, leading to improved
performances across a wide range of visual perception tasks.
Consequently, RSGPT [1] and SkyEyeGPT [5] adopt EVA as
their vision encoder. An alternative to complementing CLIP
is utilizing the strengths of diverse vision encoders. CLIP
learns visual representations through language supervision,
which limits the information retained about the image. Cap-
tions only approximate the main content of images, often
failing to present complex pixel-level details. Targeting this
limitation, some works [6], [24], [136] propose combining
vision encoders from CLIP and DINOv2 [67]. DINOv2 learns
visual representation from images alone via self-supervised
learning, enabling it to capture both image-level and pixel-
level information. Moreover, given the varied object sizes in
remote sensing images, these works refine visual representa-
tions by incorporating multi-scale information. In [6], a vision
encoder with the convolutional neural network architecture
is used to extract multi-scale visual features. In [24], [136],
the input image is downsampled to different resolutions and
then respectively fed into two vision encoders. The encoded
visual features are transformed to the same dimension and
concatenated channel-wise.
Vision-Language Connector: The linear layer and MLP
are widely used as vision-language connectors, serving as
key components in most models [3], [5], [6], [10], [11],
[142], [202], [213]. Differently, RSGPT [1] and LHRS-
Bot [9] explore alternative connector architectures. Following
InstructBLIP [46], RSGPT includes an instruction-aware query
transformer (Q-Former) as an intermediate module between
the vision encoder and LLM. The Q-Former is designed
to extract task-relevant visual representations by interacting
additional query embeddings with instruction and image em-
beddings. It achieves this through the attention mechanism:
first, self-attention is applied to implement interaction between
instruction and query embeddings, and then cross-attention is
employed between query and image embeddings. The resulting
output from the Q-Former, after passing through a linear
layer, is then input into the LLM along with the instruction
embeddings to generate responses. LHRS-Bot proposes incor-
porating multi-level image embeddings to sufficiently capture
the semantic content of images. To mitigate the computational
burden and the risk of overwhelming language information
with excessive visual information, it introduces a set of learn-
able queries for each level of visual representation. These
queries are used to summarize the semantic information of
each level through stacked cross-attention and MLP layers.
As a result, a dedicated visual perceiver is developed, with
experimental results demonstrating that, compared to single-
level visual representations and a two-layer MLP, multi-level
representations paired with the visual perceiver improve the
model’s performance in scene classification, visual question
answering, and visual grounding tasks.

B. Training Strategy
Training instruction-based vision-language models typically
involves two stages: pre-training for modality alignment and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for following task-specific in-
structions.
Only SFT: Due to the lack of large-scale image-text
datasets specifically designed for the remote sensing domain,
most works target the SFT stage using carefully crafted
instruction-following datasets [1], [3], [5], [11], [142], [213].
To preserve the general knowledge embedded in pre-trained
vision encoders, the vision encoder is typically kept frozen
during training, with the connector or the LLM undergoing
fine-tuning. For instance, RSGPT [1] fine-tunes the connector,
while GeoChat [3] and TEOChat [213] fine-tune the LLM.
SkyEyeGPT [5], SkySenseGPT [11] and IFShip [142] fine-
tune both the connector and LLM. To avoid the expense of
full-parameter tuning, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) [50] is
often adopted, which introduces low-rank learnable matrices
into the layers of the connector [5], [142] or LLM [3], [5],
[11], [142], [213].
Pre-training followed by SFT: A couple of recent works
have investigated how to implement the pre-training stage to
boost model performance. Based on the choice of training
data, they can be categorized into two groups: those that
combine available image-text pairs from multiple domains for
pre-training and those that direct attention toward creating
large-scale RS image-text datasets. For combining available
data, EarthGPT [6], Popeye [24] and RS-LLaVA [10] utilize
natural image-text datasets, while EarthMarker [136] integrates
data from both computer vision and remote sensing domains.
COCO Caption [210] is a commonly used pre-training dataset.
Unlike RS-LLaVA, which limits pre-training to the connector,
the other three models perform pre-training for the connector
and the LLM.
To address the domain gap between remote sensing im-
ages and natural images, researchers have developed large-
scale RS image-text datasets, such as LHRS-Align [9] and
VersaD [202], both of which contain over one million training
samples. Leveraging the LHRS-Align dataset, Muhtar et al. [9]
design a three-stage curriculum learning strategy for LHRS-
Bot. First, the vision perceiver is pre-trained on LHRS-Align.
Next, the vision perceiver and LLM are fine-tuned on LHRS-
Instruct subset and multi-task dataset, equipping the model to
handle multimodal tasks. Finally, the LLM undergoes addi-
tional fine-tuning on all instruction data from LHRS-Instruct,
the multi-task dataset, and LLaVA-Instruct-158K subset to
fully unlock LHRS-Bot’s capabilities. Note that these models
still keep the vision encoder frozen. In contrast, Pang et
al. [202] unfreeze the vision encoder, MLP and LLM for
pre-training on VersaD. They subsequently fine-tune the MLP
and LLM on customized datasets, including VersaD-Instruct,
HnstD and VariousRS-Instruct. Their experimental results
show that the model pre-trained with RS data significantly
outperforms the one only fine-tuned with RS data across
multiple tasks, confirming the importance of incorporating
extensive RS visual knowledge by pre-training.

C. Model Capability
Table V lists the capabilities of existing instruction-based
vision-language models in remote sensing. Key observations
include: 1) Most models are developed for general-purpose re-
mote sensing data analysis [3], [5], [6], [9], [11], [136], [202],
[213], with only Popeye [24] and IFShip [142] specifically
tailored for remote sensing images of ships. These models
primarily process optical images but have expanded to include
SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) [6], [24] and infrared [6]
images. 2) Most models support conversational interaction
with users and can perform a variety of tasks [3], [5], [6], [9],
[11], [136], [202], [213], ranging from single image analysis to
temporal series analysis [213]. 3) The granularity of analyzed
information has progressed from the image level to region
level [11], [136], and even to the point level [136]. In this
section, we examine the models’ performance on common
capabilities and offer an in-depth exploration of unique ca-
pabilities.
Common Capabilities: As shown in Table V, most
models are capable of performing remote sensing tasks such
as image captioning, scene classification, visual question an-
swering, and visual grounding. Accordingly, we present model
performance on these tasks in Tables VI-VIII. To ensure a fair
comparison, we report only the models’ performance on public
datasets. Although multi-turn Conversation is also a common
capability among existing models [3], [5], [6], [9], [11], [24],
[136], [202], [213], it is challenging to evaluate quantitatively.
Fig. 7 provides examples of conversations between various
models and users.

† indicates the model’s capability tailored for remote sensing images of ships. SIT, Cap., CLS, VQA, VG, OD, ORR, and MTC are short for Supported
Image Type, Captioning, Classification, Visual Question Answering, Visual Grounding, Object Detection, Object Relationship Reasoning, and Multi-Turn
Conversation, respectively. We present the Opt/SAR/IR column to indicate whether the model supports input of optical (Opt), synthetic aperture radar (SAR),
or infrared (IR) images, and the Img/Reg/Pt column to denote the granularity of the analyzed information, which includes image level (Img), region level
(Reg), or point level (Pt).
tions include “Describe this image in detail.” [1], [5] or “Please
provide a one-sentence caption for the provided remote sensing
image in detail.” [6]. From Table VI, we can observe that
SkyEyeGPT [5] outperforms RSGPT [1] on the RSICD [60],
UCM-captions [62] and Sydney-captions [62] datasets in terms
of BLEU [225], METEOR [226], and ROUGE L [227],
though it falls short of RSGPT in CIDEr [228] scores. On
the UCM-captions dataset, RS-LLaVA achieves BLEU scores
comparable to SkyEyeGPT while surpassing it in all other
metrics. On the NWPU-Captions [63] dataset, EarthGPT [6]
achieves state-of-the-art results, with a remarkable improve-
ment in CIDEr (nearly 30%) over EarthMarker [136].
(2) Scene Classification: Table VII presents evaluations on
10 remote sensing scene classification datasets under both fully
supervised and zero-shot settings. The absorption of extensive
remote sensing visual knowledge improves model accuracy
and generalization in scene classification tasks. Specifically,
in the supervised setting, VHM [202] and EarthGPT [6]
boost classification performance to over 93% on the NWPU-
RESISC45 [53] dataset, which includes 45 scene categories
with image spatial resolutions ranging from 0.2m to more
than 30m. For zero-shot scene classification, LHRS-Bot [9],
VHM, and SkySenseGPT [11] demonstrate impressive gen-
eralization, achieving accuracy above 91% on the AID [102]
dataset and over 93% on the WHU-RS19 [71] dataset. Sky-
SenseGPT notably achieves the highest accuracy, reaching
92.25% and 97.02% on these datasets, respectively. Despite
these remarkable results, low-resolution and fine-grained scene
classification remain significant challenges. The EuroSAT [69]
dataset, used for land use and land cover classification, has an
image spatial resolution of 10m, while fMoW [117] contains
over 1 million images across 63 scene categories. On these
datasets, LHRS-Bot [9] achieves an accuracy below 57%.
(3) Visual Question Answering: RSVQA-HR [54] and
RSVQA-LR datasets are widely adopted to assess model
performance in visual question answering tasks, as shown in
Table VII. Under a supervised setting, RSGPT [1] establishes
strong performance baselines on both datasets. Subsequent
models, including EarthGPT [6], GeoChat [3], VHM [202],
and SkySenseGPT [11], have progressively approached these
benchmarks in both supervised and zero-shot settings. The lat-
est model, SkySenseGPT, narrows the zero-shot performance
gap to approximately 13%, coming closest to the baseline on
test set 2 of the RSVQA-HR dataset and surpassing RSGPT
on the RSVQA-LR dataset in the supervised setting.
(4) Visual Grounding: aims to locate specific objects within
an image based on a natural language expression. Vision-
language models accomplish this task by providing the coordi-
nates of the target object. Table VIII presents the performance
of several models on RSVG [66] and DIOR-RSVG [33]
datasets, using an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of
0.5 adopted as the evaluation metric. LHRS-Bot [9] achieves
the highest score on the RSVG test set, while SkyEyeGPT [5]
leads on DIOR-RSVG test set. Due to differences in metric
calculations, VHM [202] achieves a score of 57.17% on
DIOR-RSVG.

Unique Capabilities: Current research seeks to develop
versatile vision-language models capable of handling vari-
ous remote sensing image analysis tasks in a conversational
manner. For instance, EarthMarker [136] supports not only
language instructions but also visual prompts (e.g. boxes and
points), enabling the model to perform fine-grained image
understanding, such as region/point-level captioning and re-
ferring object classification. TEOChat [213] excels in ana-
lyzing time-series remote sensing images, detecting changes
of interest (in the form of the bounding box), and answering
questions related to changes. Coincidentally, LHRS-Bot [9]
and VHM [202] both feature the ability to qualitatively rec-
ognize object attributes (e.g. color) and image properties (e.g.
resolution and modality), while also quantitatively counting
objects. Additionally, VHM offers insights into model hon-
esty, which is vital for applications such as national defense
security. Beyond single-object analysis, relationship analysis
between objects is increasingly recognized as essential for
understanding complex remote sensing scenes, drawing at-
tention in recent models [9], [11], [136], [202]. This section
delves into these unique capabilities, with a focus on their
implementations as detailed.
(1) Fine-grained Image Understanding: Region-level image
understanding is challenging but achievable. One can include
the coordinates of the target region in language instructions
to direct the model’s attention to a specific local region,
as demonstrated in EarthGPT [6] and GeoChat [3]. While
using precise coordinates is effective, it lacks flexibility and
is challenging to extend to the point level. Differently, Earth-
Marker [136] leverages visual prompting marks to guide the
model to interpret specific regions or points. To ensure the
model understands the relationship between visual prompts
and the whole image, the visual prompts share the same
visual encoder and projection layer with the input image. Their
embeddings are combined with instruction embeddings before
being fed into the LLM. Visual Prompts allow EarthMarker
to perform multi-granularity RS image interpretation at the
image, region, and point levels.
(2) Time-Series Image Analysis: Change detection, the pro-
Fig. 8. Examples showcasing the capabilities of TEOChat [213] in time-series
image analysis.
cess of identifying changes on the Earth’s surface from se-
quences of remote sensing images captured over the same area,
plays an important role in many applications such as urban
planning [230] and war damage assessment [229]. The work
TEOChat [213] pioneers change detection in a conversation
manner. Given a sequence of remote sensing images, TEOChat
employs a shared vision encoder to generate embeddings for
each image. These embeddings are then projected to the input
space of the LLM via a 2-layer MLP. The LLM processes these
projected image embeddings alongside instruction embeddings
to produce change detection results in the form of bound-
ing boxes. To train TEOChat, the authors of [213] develop
TEOChatlas, the first instruction-following dataset tailored
for time-series image analysis tasks. Leveraging this dataset,
TEOChat extends its capabilities beyond change detection to
include tasks such as change question answering, temporal
scene classification, temporal referring expression, and spatial
change referring expression. Fig. 8 provides specific examples
illustrating each of these tasks.
(3) From Qualitative Recognition to Quantitative Analysis:
Existing models mostly concentrate on qualitative recognition
tasks, excelling at describing the attributes or categories of
images and objects in a non-numerical manner. In contrast,
LHRS-Bot [9] and VHM [202] broaden their capabilities to
include quantitative image analysis, answering “how many”
questions. LHRS-Bot is equipped to count objects in an image
and estimate image resolution, using single-choice questions
with 2 to 4 candidate answers. This question format requires
a certain level of user expertise, as the user needs to predefine
several candidate answers, one of which must be correct.
VHM goes a step further by not only handling these tasks but
also measuring object size. Unlike LHRS-Bot, all quantitative
tasks in VHM adopt open-ended question formats, which
may be more suitable for practical application. On the test
set of the VariousRS-Instruct [202], VHM achieves mean
absolute errors of 0.24 for mage resolution estimation, 6.75 for
object counting, and 12.82 for geometric measurement. These
results highlight the potential of vision-language models to
advance quantitative analysis in remote sensing images. The

Evaluation metric adopts Acc@0.5, which means that the intersection over
union (IoU) of the predicted box is at least 0.5 with the ground truth bounding
box.
successful implementation of such analysis relies heavily on
the development of specialized instruction-following datasets,
which are discussed in detail in Section VI-B.
(4) Endowing Models with Honesty: Most instruction-
following datasets designed for remote sensing tasks exclu-
sively contain factual questions that query real objects within
the images and are accompanied by affirmative answers. This
makes vision-language models susceptible to lying, such as
providing an affirmative answer regarding a category of a
non-existent object. A dishonest vision-language model is
particularly problematic in remote sensing applications, espe-
cially in critical areas like national defense security, as it may
lead to serious negative consequences, including inaccurate
intelligence gathering. Given this, Pang et al. [202] are the
first to offer insights into the honesty of models. They create
HnstD, an RS-specific honest dataset comprising questions
with factual and deceptive categories. By utilizing it as an ad-
ditional instruction-following dataset, VHM is endowed with
honesty. As shown in Fig. 9, VHM refuses to answer questions
regarding the color or position of non-existent objects.
(5) Object Relationship Understanding: Remote sensing
images often encompass a vast number of objects, owing to
their long-distance imaging. Comprehensively understanding
the relationships between objects within an image is essen-
tial for interpreting complex remote-sensing scenes [231],
[232]. Consequently, the latest models, i.e. LHRS-Bot [9],

objects in an image. Specifically, LHRS-Bot and VHM target
spatial relationships, using simple rules like “top” or “top
right corner” to indicate object relationships. EarthMarker, on
the other hand, explores functional relationships, such as the
“overpass” and “toll station” potentially contributing to the
transportation infrastructure around the “stadium”. Meanwhile,
SkySenseGPT describes semantic relationships, for example,
the “crane” is over the “boat”. This promising understand-
ing of relationships benefits from the design of specialized
instruction-following datasets, as discussed in Section VI-B.
V. GENERATION-BASED VISION-LANGUAGE MODELING
Similar to research on contrastive-based vision-language
modeling, generation-based vision-language modeling follows
two major research directions: the construction of foundation
models concerning the characteristics of remote sensing im-
ages, and their application to promote various remote sensing
data analysis tasks. This section first presents the development
of generative foundation models and then discusses represen-
tative downstream applications.

A. Generative Foundation Models
Building an effective generative foundation model is a
formidable task because one needs to consider how to ensure
the reliability and diversity of the generated images.
Enhancing Reliability: Text, often in the form of de-
scriptions of ground objects within images [7], [39], [145],
[206], [223], [293] or semantic categories of images [38],
[207], has been a common condition for conditional image
generation. For instance, the text “a satellite view of San
Francisco showing the bay, a street and a bridge” is used to
guide RS-SD [7], while the text “a fmow satellite image of
a car dealership in the United States of America” constrains
DiffusionSat [38]. However, it is evident that these textual
descriptions alone struggle to fully encapsulate the variety of
objects and intricate relationships present within a satellite
image. The lack of sufficient constraint information poses
a challenge to generating reliable images. To address this
challenge, additional conditions, such as metadata or images,
are increasingly utilized to constrain the generation process.
(1)
Metadata:
Metadata
such
as
latitude,
longitude,
ground sampling distance, cloud cover, and imaging time
(year, month, and day) are adopted in both Diffusion-
Sat [38] and CRS-Diff [39]. In contrast, MetaEarth [208]
and
Text2Earth
[293]
focus
on
spatial
resolution,
and
GeoSynth [223] on geographic location (latitude and longi-
tude). Compared to text conditions, metadata is more easily
available, as it is inherently embedded within remote sensing
images. Furthermore, it allows generative foundation models
to be trained on large-scale image datasets, benefiting from
the diverse geographic distribution of these datasets. Con-
sequently, the key problem lies in addressing how to inject
metadata conditions into diffusion models. Identical to the
encoding of diffusion timesteps, DiffusionSat and MetaEarth
process metadata values through sinusoidal encoding, followed
by MLPs. The resulting metadata embeddings are added
with timestep embeddings before being fed into the diffusion
model. CRS-Diff maps metadata values to a fixed range and
encodes them using different MLPs. The metadata embeddings
are concatenated with text and content embeddings, providing
global control information. For latitude and longitude, an
alternative approach is to utilize a pre-trained location encoder.
An example is [223] where the authors employ SatCLIP [35]
to extract location embeddings and use CoordNet, which takes
location and timestep embeddings as input, to integrate these
conditions into the diffusion model. CoordNet consists of
13 multi-head cross-attention blocks, each including a zero-
initialized feed-forward layer.
(2) Image: Metadata, such as geographic location, deter-
mines the visual appearance of objects in generated images to
some extent. For example, the architectural styles of Chinese
and European buildings are notably distinct. However, meta-
data primarily imposes constraints at a macro level, allowing
considerable flexibility in the generated objects, which can
result in uncontrollable object shapes. As a result, recent works
have investigated the use of image-form conditions to enable
more precise control over the image generation process. Based
on the information conveyed by the image, image conditions
are roughly split into low-level visual conditions and high-
level semantic conditions. Low-level visual conditions per-
tain to the geometric information of images, such as edges,
line segments, and sketches, which constrain the shape and
structure of objects in generated images, as demonstrated
in works [39], [207]. Off-the-shelf algorithms or models,
including HED [238], LETR [239] and the model proposed


===== PAGE 17 =====
17
in [240], are employed to obtain these image conditions.
High-level semantic conditions, as the name implies, refer to
the semantic information of images, providing constraints on
object categories and their relationships in generated images.
These conditions can be further categorized into two sub-
groups. The first group [38], [206], [208], [293] conditions
on associated remote sensing images, exemplified by works
such as MetaEarth [208], which uses low-resolution images
to prompt the diffusion model to produce high-resolution
images, and GPG2A [206], which synthesizes aerial images
guided by layout maps derived from corresponding ground
images. The second group [39], [207], [223] leverages abstract
representations of image content, as seen in works like CRS-
Diff [39] and GeoSynth [223]. CRS-Diff utilizes road maps,
segmentation masks, and deep features to constrain the layout
and objects within generated images, while GeoSynth employs
OpenStreetMap (OSM) images to achieve similar constraints
on layout and object placement.
Image-form conditions are typically injected into diffu-
sion models using ControlNet [234]. ControlNet replicates
the encoder blocks and the middle block of Stable Diffu-
sion’s U-Net and incorporates several zero convolutions. It
processes both conditioning representations and noisy latent
representations as inputs, with its outputs added to the decoder
blocks and middle block of Stable Diffusion’s U-Net. In
GeoSynth [223] and GPG2A [206], ControlNet is used for
condition injection with different inputs: GeoSynth provides
layout maps derived from ground images, while GPG2A inputs
OSM images, text, and diffusion timesteps. To enhance multi-
condition injection, DiffusionSat [38] extends ControlNet into
a 3D version capable of accepting a sequence of satellite
images. This 3D ControlNet retains the replicated encoder
and middle blocks, with each followed by a temporal layer
consisting of a 3D zero-convolution and a temporal, pixel-
wise transformer. Following Uni-ControlNet [241], the authors
in [39], [207] perform multi-scale condition injection and
use attentional feature fusion [242] to combine conditioning
and latent representations. Unlike these works relying on
ControlNet, MetaEarth and Text2Earth directly concatenate
latent and image condition representations. MetaEarth encodes
low-resolution images via RRDBNet [236] with upsampling
and convolution layers, while Text2Earth processes masked
images using a VAE encoder [204].
Improving Diversity: Herein, diversity refers to two
aspects: first, the generated objects exhibit a variety of se-
mantic categories, with each category featuring varied vi-
sual characteristics; and second, the generated images cap-
ture a broad range of variations in imaging condition (e.g.
season and illumination) and imaging sensors (e.g. spatial
resolution and viewpoint). By conditioning on metadata, the
diversity of the generated data is improved as shown in
Fig. 10. DiffusionSat [38] modifies geographic coordinates,
imaging time, and ground sampling distance, resulting in
varied stadiums, different scenes, and multi-resolution images,
respectively. In addition to considering the perspective of
conditions, some works [145], [208] explore new frameworks
for generating multi-resolution images. In [145], cascaded
diffusion models [147] are employed, where one model gen-

erates low-resolution images conditioned on text embeddings,
and the other super-resolves these low-resolution images. This
framework achieves the gradual generation of high-resolution
satellite images purely from textual descriptions. In [208],
a resolution-guided self-cascading framework is proposed to
generate images at various resolutions, instead of being limited
to the two resolutions described in [145]. As illustrated in
Fig. 11, the generation process unfolds over multiple stages,
with each stage conditioned on the low-resolution image
output from the preceding stage and its corresponding spatial
resolution. The resolution increases at a fixed ratio with each
stage. Considering the resolution gap between adjacent stages,
the image condition is injected through a sequential process
involving an image encoder, followed by several upsampling
and convolution layers. Building on this framework, the au-
thors introduce sliding windows with overlaps and a noise
sampling strategy to generate continuous, unbounded scenes.
Performance Evaluation: With these efforts, existing
generative foundation models have demonstrated the capability
to generate optical remote sensing images [7], [38], [39],
[145], [206], [208], [223] or hyperspectral remote sensing
images [207]. Their performance is typically evaluated using
metrics such as Fr´echet Inception Distance [243] and Incep-
tion Score [244]. For text-conditioned models, CLIP [86] is
employed to measure the similarity between generated images
and their corresponding textual descriptions, as detailed in Ta-
ble X. In addition to the direct evaluations, some works assess
model performance by applying them or the generated images
to specific downstream tasks and measuring their impact [38],
[39], [206]–[208]. For example, DiffusionSat [38] is applied
to tasks such as super-resolution and temporal generation, and
in-painting, while CRS-Diff [39] uses its generated images to
augment training datasets of the road detection model.
B. Downstream Applications

satile tools for advancing various remote sensing tasks. Their

exceptional image generation capabilities have been utilized
to tackle challenges such as limited image availability [250]
and the high costs associated with annotation [251], [252].
Additionally, the conditionally controllable nature of these
models makes them particularly suitable for remote sensing
image enhancement tasks. Examples include tasks like super-
resolution [245], [246], where low-resolution images serve
as conditions, and cloud removal [253], [254], where SAR
images are used as conditions. Moreover, their advantages
in learning diverse remote sensing image distribution equip
them to handle the complexity of remote sensing scenes,
improving the accuracy of remote sensing image interpretation
tasks such as change detection [247], [248] and land cover
classification [249]. These advancements predominantly center
on the ability of generative foundation models to model
image distribution, which has been comprehensively reviewed
in [205]. In this discussion, however, we shift the focus
to recently emerging applications that show how the joint
distribution between images and texts in generative foundation
models promotes advancements in remote sensing tasks. This
includes tasks such as image or change captioning [150],
[154], pansharpening [148] , and zero-shot target recogni-
tion [155], as illustrated in Table XI. This section delves into
representative implementations in conjunction with specific
tasks.
Captioning: Recent works [150], [154] propose generat-
ing textual descriptions conditioned on visual features, rather
than generating images from textual descriptions, thus apply-
ing generative models for captioning remote sensing images.
In [150], the authors focus on extracting both global and
local features of remote sensing images to enhance the visual
conditions for the generative model, addressing challenges
such as intra-class diversity, inter-class similarity, and varying
object sizes. They then improve the interaction between noisy
representations and visual conditions in the decoder by se-
quentially interacting with global and local conditions, aiming
for generated captions that better align with the image content.
In [154], difference features of bi-temporal images condition
the generative model to generate change captions from stan-
dard Gaussian noise. These difference features are integrated
into the generative model using cross-attention, followed by
stacking self-attention. Inspired by the success of generative
models in change detection [261], the authors in [255] employ
these models as a powerful feature extractor for multi-level,
multi-timestep features of bi-temporal images. A difference
encoder, based on a time-channel-spatial attention mechanism,
is then utilized to extract discriminative information from
the features of bi-temporal images, and a decoder generates
change captions from this information.
Pansharpening: is a process of fusing high-resolution
panchromatic images with low-resolution multispectral images
to produce high-resolution multispectral images. The idea of
applying generative foundation models to this task involves
formulating it as an image generation problem conditioned
on panchromatic and multispectral images. To enhance the
generalizability of the pansharpening model and enable it to
uniformly handle multispectral images from different satel-
lites, TMDiff [148] incorporates textual descriptions, such
as “Text Prompts of GaoFen-2 Satellite”, as identifiers to
specify the satellites that capture multispectral images. These
descriptions, combined with panchromatic-multispectral im-
age pairs, jointly guide the generation process. Specifically,
the textual descriptions are processed by a physics-informed
HyperNet to get text embeddings, which are then used to
modulate the denoising network. Meanwhile, the image pair
is injected into the decoder of the denoising network via a
condition encoder that shares the same architecture as the
network’s encoder. To address the variability in spectral band
configurations among different satellites, TMDiff, built on the
U-Net architecture, organizes each block with stacked mod-
ulated ResBlock, swish activation layer, and frequency-aware
downsampling (or upsampling). Compared to PanDiff [257],
which relies solely on image conditions, TMDiff demonstrates
impressive generalization capabilities.
Zero-shot SAR Target Recognition: Due to the high
costs associated with SAR imaging and the limited azimuth
range for capturing images, SAR datasets are often small,
making it essential to explore SAR target recognition in zero-
shot settings. From the perspective of SAR image simu-
lation, adopting generative foundation models for this task
is a natural solution. Typically, Wang et al. [155] employ
generative models to create 3D models of targets conditioned
on semantic information, such as category and structure of
targets. Since most existing generative models are trained on
RGB natural images or optical remote sensing images, the
authors adopt a two-step process: they first use the generative
model to generate optical images based on the target semantic
information, and then transform these optical images into
into 3D models using TripoSR [258], rather than directly
generating 3D models or SAR images.
Cloud Removal: Passive remote sensing is susceptible to
cloud interference. By conditioning on cloud-contaminated im-
ages and SAR images, generative models have been employed
for cloud removal of remote sensing images [253], [254]. Such
solutions require geographically aligned multimodal image
pairs, which are challenging to obtain in practical applica-
tions. To overcome this limitation, Czerkawski et al. [259]
propose a novel approach that uses historical edge information

that general-purpose generative models may not be directly
applicable for cloud removal of remote sensing images, as they
tend to generate undesirable artifacts in cloud-contaminated
areas.
Urban Prediction: aims to forecast future urban layouts
based on current urban layouts and planned change maps,
providing support for urban planning. The pioneering work,
UP-Diff [149], incorporates ConvNeXt [260] to encode current
urban layouts and planned change maps into embeddings,
which are subsequently injected into the decoder of diffusion
models through cross-attention layers. Additionally, the text
condition, derived from encoding “A remote sensing photo”,
guides the model to generate outputs in a satellite image style.
VI. DATASETS
Large-scale datasets are an essential prerequisite for vision-
language research under the two-stage paradigm. Thus, a
considerable amount of current research [1], [7]–[9], [11],
[12], [22], [156], [202] focuses on dataset construction. In this
section, we summarize these efforts, detailing the properties of
datasets and their creation methods, with the aim of providing
both convenience and inspiration for further research. Based
on their usage, existing datasets can be broadly categorized
into three groups: pre-training datasets, instruction-following
datasets, and benchmark datasets.
A. Pre-training Datasets
Pre-training datasets, which consist of remote sensing im-
ages and their corresponding texts, play a crucial role in
infusing the model with a broad range of visual and language
concepts. This requires the images in pre-training datasets
to be sufficiently diverse and rich. Currently, there are two
alternative sources for collecting images: one is combining
various open-source remote sensing image datasets [1], [2],
[7], [22], [29], [202], [293], and the other is utilizing public
geographic databases [8], [9], [31], [143], [293]. Once the
images are collected, corresponding textual descriptions can
be generated through manual annotation [1], [31]. Although
manual annotation is easy to implement and highly accurate,
the complexity and diversity of remote sensing images make
it costly, which can significantly limit the dataset size. As
a result, there is a growing shift toward automatic image
captioning using rule-based methods [2], [8] or off-the-shelf
models [7], [9], [22], [143], [202], [293]. This section begins
by presenting the image collection strategies of existing pre-
training datasets, followed by an introduction to their caption
generation methods.
Image Collection: Object detection datasets in remote
sensing typically feature diverse ground objects, such as
DOTA [45] containing 1,793,658 instances across 18 cate-
gories, and DIOR [51] including 192,472 instances spanning
20 categories. These datasets have quickly garnered atten-
tion and have been instrumental in constructing pre-training
datasets, leading to the development of RSICap [1] and
DIOR-Captions [29]. Compared to relying on a single dataset,
combining multiple datasets further enriches the diversity of
images and objects while significantly increasing the dataset
size. For instance, RET-3+SEG-4+DET-10 [2] integrates three
datasets for image retrieval, four for image segmentation, and
ten for object detection. VersaD [202] further emphasizes
multi-resolution and multi-domain coverage, drawing from
datasets such as CVUSA [264] (0.08m resolution), Million-
AID [100] (0.5m to 153m resolution, covering diverse geogra-
phies), and LoveDA [126] (featuring urban and rural environ-
ments). RS5M [7] prioritizes large-scale image datasets, in-
corporating sources like BigEarthNet [113] (590,326 images),
fMoW [117] (1,047,691 images), and Million-AID (over 1
million images). Moreover, RS5M integrates PUB11, a dataset
of over 3 million remote sensing-related image-text pairs

ChatGPT-4V separately, and in RS5M for PUB11 and other remote sensing datasets separately.
filtered from 11 computer vision datasets, including LAION-
400M [209] and CC3M [266]. PUB11 creation involved
sequential steps such as invalid image checking, deduplication,
filtering using a CLIP model, and employing a remote sensing
image detector. These pre-training datasets support the devel-
opment of vision-language models beyond specific airborne or
satellite sensors. An exception is ChatEarthNet [22], which is
tailored for satellite image analysis and sources images from
the Sentinel-2 collected in SatlasPretrain [119].
In addition to open-source image datasets, public geographic
databases contribute to the extensive collection of remote
sensing images [8], [9], [31], [143], [293]. For example, LuoJi-
aHOG [31] derives its images from Google Maps, determining
global sampling points through spatial analysis and the evalu-
ation of landscape indices. This method ensures the inclusion
of images representing diverse topographies and varying eco-
nomic conditions across countries and regions. Leveraging a
customized OpenStreetMap (OSM) database, LHRS-Align [9]
collects remote sensing images from Google Earth, ensuring
their centers are aligned with OSM features. These images
then undergo a series of processing steps, including resizing
to a uniform size, deduplication to remove images dominated
by vast ocean areas or obscured by clouds, and pruning using
a trained network. The final dataset encompasses images from
9,259 cities across 129 countries. Similarly, Git-10M [293]
consists mainly of remote sensing images from Google Earth,
which are gathered from both randomly selected and manually
curated regions worldwide. Manual screening is performed to
discard redundant scenes, and an image enhancement model
is applied to all collected images, thereby improving dataset
quality. SkyScript [8] and RSTeller [143] are sourced from
Google Earth Engine. Among these, the authors of SkyScript
carefully choose 10 image collections from Google Earth
Engine, such as SWISSIMAGE 10cm RGB imagery and
Landsat 9 C2 T1 TOA Reflectance, forming a multi-source,
multi-resolution image pool. In contrast, RSTeller relies solely
on one image collection, the National Agriculture Imagery
Program, which provides aerial images covering most of the
continental United States and parts of Hawaii, with a ground
sampling distance of 0.6m.
Caption Generation: Texts associated with remote sens-
ing images in pre-training datasets, also referred to as image
captions, are typically human-understandable sentences that
describe various aspects of the images. These descriptions of-
ten include information about image properties, overall scenes,
and specific local objects. In existing pre-training datasets,
only RSICap [1] and DIOR-Captions [29] rely entirely on
manual annotation to generate image captions. In [1], five
remote sensing experts carried out the annotation process
following predefined principles. The principles consist of three
points: first, describing image attributes; second, describing
object attributes; and third, providing a description of the
overall scene before detailing specific objects. In [29], the
authors refer to bounding boxes from the original image
dataset to describe the most prominent or abundant objects.
Although manual annotation guarantees high-quality image-
text pairs, it is a time-intensive and laborious process, partic-
ularly for large-scale datasets. To address this, later datasets
have adopted automated methods, employing rules or models
to generate captions. This approach significantly reduces the
cost of dataset creation while greatly expanding its scale.
(1) Rule-based Captioning: Motivated by the fact that open-
source image datasets are accompanied by image semantic in-
formation in the form of bounding boxes, segmentation masks,
and class names, Liu et al. [2] propose the box-to-caption
(B2C) and mask-to-box (M2B) methods to convert heteroge-
neous annotations into natural language captions. In detail,
B2C, designed for bounding box annotations, generates five
distinct captions for each image by considering the location
(bounding box center) and the number of objects. Meanwhile,
M2B, tailored for segmentation mask annotations, converts
segmentation masks into bounding boxes by first extracting
contours for each class and then sorting the contour points
to define the bounding boxes. By applying M2B followed by
B2C, it becomes convenient to create image-text datasets from
image segmentation datasets. With a similar motivation, Wang
et al. [8] leverage semantic information from OSM to caption
remote sensing images from Google Earth Engine, as the two

can be linked through geo-coordinates. Due to its uncurated
nature, semantic information from OSM is rich but often
messy. Consequently, not all this information is suitable for
describing images, especially if it is not visually discernible.
To address this, the authors leverage CLIP embeddings of
semantic information as input and apply a binary logistic
regression model to filter out invisible information. After
filtering, a description for each object is crafted by assembling
OSM semantic data using connecting words such as “of”, “is”,
“and”. Each image includes two captions: one describing the
object used to determine the image boundary, and another
describing multiple objects within the image by assembling
captions of individual objects based on their geospatial rela-
tionships. To reduce noisy image-text pairs, they finally use
a CLIP model to estimate the similarity between images and
texts, and perform image filtering.
(2) Model-based Captioning: Numerous large language
models are available for generating remote sensing image
captions, including ChatGPT series [267], Gemini [265], Vi-
cuna [47], and Mixtural [144]. To effectively apply these
models, the key research focus lies in prompt design, as cap-
tion quality heavily depends on the prompt. The fundamental
principle of prompt design is to align with the input require-
ments of the LLM being used. For multimodal LLMs such
as ChatGPT-4V, Gemini-Vision, BLIP-2 [118], and MiniGPT-
4 [129], which can process both text and image inputs, the
prompt can simply instruct the model to generate a caption
like “generate a description for the image’s visual content” [7].
However, to improve caption quality, prompts are optimized
by adding constraints on the model’s response [22], [31], [202]
or incorporating semantic information about the image [22],
[31], [293]. For instance, VersaD [202] defines prompts to
ensure the captions generated by Gemini-Vision encompass in-
formation about image properties, object attributes, and scene
context, while preventing the model from describing uncertain
objects. Furthermore, it imposes constraints on the format of
the model’s response. LuoJiaHOG [31] prompts MiniGPT-4 to
follow principles such as describing object attributes, reducing
vague words, using “next” instead of “up”, adding synonyms,
and more. Incorporating image semantic information into the
prompt helps guide the model’s focus toward the image content
of interest, while enriching the captions. For example, in
ChatEarthNet [22], the distribution and proportion of various
land cover types in the image, derived from the European
Space Agency (ESA)’s WorldCover project, are embedded into
the prompt to guide ChatGPT-4V in describing the land cover
types of interest. In LuoJiaHOG, manually corrected OSM
semantics are provided to MiniGPT-4, allowing the model to
describe objects of interest within the images.
For models like ChatGPT-3.5, Vicuna-v1.5, and Mixtral,
which primarily handle text inputs, providing image semantic
information in the prompt allows the models to simulate
“seeing” the image and generate captions. LHRS-Align [9] and
RSTeller [143] both utilize OSM semantics to assist the model
in understanding the image. Since the quality of the semantic
information directly impacts the quality of the captions, a
significant portion of the effort in caption generation for these
two datasets is devoted to carefully processing the semantic
data. For example, similar to SkyScript [8], LHRS-Align filters
out invisible semantic information using rules, followed by
manual inspection. Additionally, LHRS-Align removes dupli-
cate semantics for each image and applies a threshold to
ensure semantic balance across the entire dataset. Given that an
image is often associated with abundant OSM semantic data,
providing all of it to the LLM can be overwhelming, making it
difficult for the model to generate accurate captions. Therefore,
RSTeller focuses on describing the primary object in each
image, defined by the largest size or longest length, and refers
to the OSM Wiki to interpret the OSM semantics, thereby
reducing the ambiguity of the semantic information. Based on
the processed OSM semantic data, LHRS-Align and RSTeller
use custom templates to integrate semantic information into
the prompt. To enhance the model’s understanding of the
captioning task, a few examples are provided to the model.
Based on the captions generated by models, some tech-
niques are proposed to enrich the captions further. In
RS5M [7], the meta-information of images, e.g. longitude, lat-
itude, and timestamp, is structured into readable sentences and
combined with the generated captions. Additionally, RS5M in-
cludes rotation-invariant captions, which are those that exhibit
the most stable similarity to the image features, regardless of
their rotation, among the generated captions. In RSTeller, the
LLM is guided to create multiple revisions from the generated
captions with different tones, resulting in each image being
accompanied by at least two captions, and up to five in total.
Dataset Property: Table XII provides an overview of
existing pre-training datasets for vision-language modeling in
remote sensing, with several key points worth noting:
(1) Geographic Coverage: The datasets RS5M, VersaD, and
ChatEarthNet benefit from large-scale remote sensing image
datasets, while SkyScript, LHRS-Align, LuoJiaHOG, and Git-
10M derive from public geographic databases. Each of these
datasets provides relatively comprehensive global coverage,
with Git-10M being the largest (over 10 million image-text
pairs). In contrast, RSTeller’s coverage is primarily limited to
the continental United States and parts of Hawaii, potentially
introducing geographic bias in trained models.
(2) Scene Diversity: Large-scale datasets such as RS5M,
LHRS-Align, and SkyScript have, to some extent, ensured
diversity in remote sensing scenes. Taking this a step further,
the creators of LuoJiaHOG employ geospatial analysis to
collect images from global regions with varied topography and
different development levels. Meanwhile, the Git-10M team
manually selects specific areas to ensure comprehensive cov-
erage of representative scenes, including urban areas, forests,
mountains, and deserts.
(3) Caption Quality: Manually annotated or rule-generated
image captions typically achieve high accuracy. For instance,
manual inspection of 1,000 randomly sampled image-text pairs
from SkyScript demonstrates 96.1% precision. Conversely,
model-generated captions inevitably contain errors despite
considerable efforts to mitigate noise injection. For smaller-
scale datasets like ChatEarthNet, manual correction can sig-
nificantly improve caption quality. However, this approach
becomes prohibitively expensive for million-scale datasets
such as VersaD and RS5M, making caption errors unavoidable.


===== PAGE 22 =====

Surprisingly, the authors of VersaD experimentally verified
that models pre-trained on the noisy dataset VersaD (82.3%)
outperformed those trained on the more accurate dataset
SkyScript, suggesting that rich-content and long captions may
make models less sensitive to noise.
(4) Distinctive Characteristics: Current pre-training datasets
predominantly contain English text, with DIOR-Captions
being the only exception that provides bilingual captions
in both Chinese and English. This enables the exploration
of cross-lingual vision-language alignment. Moreover, while
most datasets focus on optical images, ChatEarthNet stands
out by facilitating a deeper understanding of multispectral
images by offering satellite images with nine specific bands,
each paired with textual descriptions.
B. Instruction-Following Datasets
Instruction-following datasets are specifically designed for
the supervised fine-tuning of instruction-based vision-language
models, allowing them to perform specific remote sensing
tasks. For contrastive or generation-based vision-language
models, the emphasis during task-specific applications lies
more on designing network architectures than on developing
new datasets, as discussed in Sections III-B and V-B. There-
fore, in the fine-tuning phase of vision-language modeling,
we exclusively summarize instruction-following datasets. This
type of dataset is comprised of images paired with conversa-
tions, structured as instructions (or questions) and answers.
Its construction involves image collection and conversation
generation, with images primarily sourced from open-source
remote sensing image datasets, as shown in Table XIII. The
main challenge lies in generating conversations, which is
addressed in this section, followed by an overview of notable
instruction-following datasets.
Conversation Generation: Since sourced image datasets
come with task-specific annotations, the most intuitive idea
is to convert these annotations into a dialogue format. Cur-
rently, three methods are commonly used for this conversion:
template-based transformation, large model assistance, and
manual annotation. Below, we demonstrate each method with
examples from specific tasks.
(1) Template-Based Transformation: To create task-specific
conversations, open-source image datasets for the given task
are typically used. Answers are derived directly from dataset
annotations, while instructions are either manually defined or
randomly selected from a pool generated by large language
models. This pool contains instructions tailored to specific
tasks, conveying the same meanings with varied phrasing.
For example, in MMRS-1M [6], classification datasets such
as NWPU-RESISC45 [53] and EuroSAT [69], along with
object detection datasets like DIOR [51] and DOTA [45], are
selected to create instruction-following data for classification
and detection tasks. For scene classification, the authors design
instructions using the template “What is the category of this
remote sensing image? Answer the question using a single
word or phrase. Reference categories include category 1,
..., and category n”. For object detection, the template is
“Detect all objects shown in the remote sensing image and
describe using oriented bounding boxes”. In SkyEye-968k [5],
corresponding datasets are selected for image captioning and
visual grounding tasks, including UCM-captions [62], Sydney-
captions [62], RSVG [66], and DIOR-RSVG [33]. Separate
instruction pools are constructed for each task. The image
captioning pool includes instructions such as “Briefly describe
this image” or “Provide a concise depiction of this image.”
Meanwhile, the visual grounding pool contains instructions
like “Give me the location of referring expression” or “Where
is referring expression?”. Based on task-specific instruction-
following data, multi-turn conversations can be generated by
mixing data from different tasks [5], [6].
(2) Large Model Assistance: Simple template-based trans-
formations are insufficient for generating instruction-following
data for complex reasoning tasks, which equip vision-language
models with higher-order cognitive abilities, such as making
decisions and identifying relationships. Additionally, multi-
turn conversations created through multi-task mixing af-
ter template transformation often lack diversity. To address
these issues, large language models are utilized to generate
instruction-following data. By providing a few manually de-
fined in-context examples, the models learn to create high-
quality instruction-answer pairs based on image captions and
other related information. For instance, Kuckreja et al. [3]
prompt Vicuna [47] to generate 30,000 detailed image descrip-
tions, 65,000 multi-turn conversations, and 10,000 complex
reasoning based on short descriptions supplied. Similarly,
Muhtar et al. [9] use Vicuna [47] to produce instruction-
following data based on image captions from RSITMD [61]
and NWPU-Captions [63]. To ensure that the generated con-
versations focus on the visual content of the images, their
prompts are designed to generate questions that inquire about
object types, actions, locations, relative positions between
objects, and more. However, considering the limitations of
RSITMD and NWPU-Captions, where captions are short and
lack detailed content, the authors supplemented their data with
additional image-caption pairs from LHRS-Align [9]. GPT-4
is prompted with image captions, object bounding boxes, and
object attributes, to generate detailed image descriptions, com-
plex reasoning, and multi-turn conversations that incorporate
questions about object locations and counts.

Manual
Annotation:
In
constructing
instruction-
following datasets, manual annotation primarily serves to pro-
vide accurate information that supports template-based or large
model-assisted conversation generation methods, rather than
directly creating conversations. For example, in FIT-RS [11],
an instruction-following dataset for understanding semantic
relationships between objects, Luo et al. [11] manually anno-
tate very high-resolution remote sensing images with detailed
scene graph labels, laying the groundwork for generating
conversations focused on relationship comprehension tasks.
In TITANIC-FGS [142], the authors manually summarize the
common and private features of fine-grained objects, which are
used to populate predefined templates for creating object de-
scriptions. These descriptions are subsequently used to prompt
GPT-4, enabling the generation of multi-turn conversations
that simulate human-like logical decision-making.
The three methods can be combined to facilitate the con-

struction of instruction-following datasets [11], [136], with the
goal of creating rich and diverse samples across a variety
of tasks. To help vision-language models better distinguish
between tasks, a common practice is to incorporate task-
specific identifiers into the instructions, as demonstrated in
[3], [5], [9], [202]. One example is [5] where the authors
introduce task identifiers such as “[caption]”, “[vqa]”, and
“[refer]” to specify captioning, visual question answering, and
visual grounding tasks, respectively.
Impressive Datasets: Table XIII provides an overview
of existing instruction-following datasets. MMShip [24] and
TITANIC-FGS [142] are specifically tailored for ship image
analysis, whereas the others are designed for general-purpose
remote sensing data analysis. Most datasets include instruction
data for tasks such as captioning, visual question answering,
visual grounding, and multi-turn conversations [3], [5], [6],
[9], [11], [30], [30], [142], [213]. Among these, MMRS-
1M [6] stands out for featuring instruction data that involves
not only optical remote sensing images but also synthetic
aperture radar and infrared images. To achieve this, three SAR
image datasets, i.e. AIR-SARShip-2.0 [75], SSDD [79] and
HRISD [90], along with six infrared image datasets (HIT-
UAV [80], Sea-shippng [81], Infrared-security [82], Aerial-
mancar [83], Double-light-vehicle [84] and Oceanic ship [85])
are incorporated into the creation of instruction-following data.
Beyond supporting common tasks, some datasets incorporate
innovative instruction data that endow vision-language mod-
els with impressive capabilities. These include fine-grained
image understanding, time-series image analysis, quantitative
analysis, honest question answering, and object relationship
comprehension. The remainder of this section offers a detailed
discussion of these datasets.

ing image. These masks include bounding boxes or points,
highlighting regions or points of interest specified by the
user within the image. For a specific task, visual prompts
in the instructions are described as “each marked point” or
“each marked region”, directing the model to focus on the
indicated areas and perform the corresponding analysis. For
example, in point-level classification, the instruction can be
“Please identify the category of each marked point in the
image.”, with the model’s response formatted as “<Mark 1>:
Label 1\n <Mark 2>: Label 2\n”. Similarly, for region-level
classification, instructions like “Please identify the category of
each marked region in the image.” yield “<Region 1>: Label
1\n <Region 2>: Label 2\n”. To preserve the model’s image-
level capabilities, image-level visual prompts are represented
as bounding boxes with dimensions [0, 0, width, height].
Based on these definitions, RSVP-3M source images from 28
existing datasets spanning tasks such as image classification,
image caption, object detection, and instance segmentation.
Ground truth bounding boxes or masks from these datasets
are used as visual prompts. Furthermore, GPT-4V is employed
to automatically generate instruction data, resulting in over
3 million samples. This large-scale dataset empowers Earth-
Marker [136] with multi-granularity understanding of remote
sensing images across image, region, and point levels for tasks
like classification, captioning, and relationship analysis.
(2) TEOChatlas [213] seeks to unlock the potential of
vision-language models for time-series image analysis. It pro-
vides instruction data for a variety of temporal tasks, including
temporal scene classification, change detection (represented by
bounding boxes), temporal referring expression, spatial change
referring expression, and image/region change question an-
swering. These tasks span two real-world applications: disaster
response and urban development monitoring. Fig. 8 illustrates
examples of each task. To ensure diverse image sequence
lengths and image sources, TEOChatlas integrates datasets
such as xBD [215], S2Looking [216], QFabric [217], and
fMoW [117], which cover bi-temporal, penta-temporal, and
multitemporal sequences. These datasets are sourced from six
different sensors, namely WordView-2/3, Sentinel-2, GaoFen,
SuperView, and BeiJing-2. Building on this diverse data foun-
dation, conversation generation is assisted by GPT-4o [267],
resulting in 245,210 samples tailored for temporal tasks. In
addition, TEOChatlas incorporates 308,861 samples from the
instruction-following dataset of GeoChat [3], which focuses on
single-image analysis. To help the model differentiate between
single-image tasks and temporal tasks, task-specific instruc-
tions are supplemented with prompts that explicitly specify
the input consists of a sequence of images and, optionally,
indicate the resolution and sensor name of the input images.
(3) LHRS-Instruct [9], VariousRS-Instruct [202] initiate the
exploration of applying vision-language models for quanti-
tative image analysis. In LHRS-Instruct, GPT-4 is prompted
with image captions and detailed information about the types
and coordinates of objects within the image. This allows
GPT-4 to generate conversations centered on the number of
objects, thereby equipping LHRS-Bot [9] with the capability
to perform object counting. VariousRS-Instruct, on the other
hand, extends its functionality beyond object counting by

incorporating instruction data designed for geometric mea-
surement tasks, aimed at estimating the length and width of
objects within images. This instruction data is derived from
the DOTA [45] and FAIR1M [52] datasets through a process
of template-based conversion. Ground truth for object sizes
is determined using image resolution and the sizes of ob-
jects’ bounding boxes. Beyond quantitative tasks, VariousRS-
Instruct also introduces new qualitative tasks such as building
vectorizing and multi-label classification. These advancements
contribute to the evolution of a versatile vision-language model
for comprehensive remote sensing image analysis.
(4) HnstD [202] aims to enhance the honesty of vision-
language models. It incorporates four recognition tasks: iden-
tifying the relative positions between objects, their presence,
color, and absolute positions. Except for the presence task, all
others include both factual and deceptive instructions. Specif-
ically, deceptive instructions regarding object color arise from
either the absence of objects or their presence in panchromatic
images, while those for relative and absolute positions stem
from the absence of objects. This combination of factual and
deceptive instructions helps prevent models from producing
affirmative answers to unreasonable user queries. To construct
HnstD, template-based transformations are applied to images
sourced from the DOTA [45] and FAIR1M [52] datasets. The
model’s response formats vary by task: “yes” or “no” for the
presence task, free-form text for the color task, and option
selection from candidates for relative and absolute position
tasks. Fig. 12 presents samples from the HnstD dataset.
(5) FIT-RS [11] is designed to advance vision-language
models’ ability to comprehend fine-grained semantic relation-
ships, introducing tasks such as object relationship reasoning
and scene graph generation at both region and image levels.
Object relationship reasoning is further divided into relation
detection and relation reasoning. Relation detection requires
the model to predict relationships between targets based on
the provided categories and locations of subjects and objects,
while relation reasoning demands the model to additionally
infer the categories of the subject or object along with their
relationships. Region-level scene graph generation involves


===== PAGE 25 =====
25
describing an object’s relative size, position, and visibility, fol-
lowed by generating all subject-relation-object triples. Image-
level scene graph generation extends this by creating scene
graphs for entire images, appending isolated objects(with no
relationships) to the answer in an object detection format.
These tasks challenge vision-language models to accurately
interpret relationships between targets and distinguish between
subjects and objects within those relationships. To construct
FIT-RS, the scene graph generation dataset STAR [88], con-
taining over 400,000 triplets across 48 object categories and
58 semantic relationship categories, serves as the data source.
Template-based transformations are applied to generate task-
specific instruction data. Similar to most instruction-following
datasets, FIT-RS also supports tasks such as captioning and
visual question answering. In total, it comprises 1,800,851
samples.
C. Benchmark Datasets
Benchmark datasets are essential for evaluating and fairly
comparing the performance of different models. To foster re-
search in vision-language modeling for remote sensing, efforts
have been made to develop benchmark datasets that integrate
remote sensing images with text. Consequently, datasets like
UCM-captions [62], RSICD [60], and RSVQA [54] have
been established and are widely utilized to assess models’
abilities in visual perception, text understanding, and image-
text alignment [2], [7], [9], [202]. However, the limited
scale and task-specific design of these existing datasets have
proven inadequate for a comprehensive evaluation of modern
vision-language models. These advanced models, benefiting
from the two-stage training paradigm and large-scale training
datasets, excel at handling diverse remote sensing image
analysis tasks in a conversational manner. In response to
this, researchers have begun crafting large-scale benchmark
datasets that encompass diverse tasks and are carefully de-
signed to align with the input-output requirements of models,
aiming to challenge vision-language models and push the
boundaries of their capabilities. This section highlights these
new research advancements [12], [32], [156], [273], [274],
categorizing benchmark datasets into two types: instruction-
specific datasets and general-purpose datasets, based on the
organization of their samples. Note that remote sensing image
datasets, such as AID [102] and NWPU-RESISC45 [53],
which have been adapted for evaluating the performance of
vision-language models through appropriate transformations,
are comprehensively reviewed in [100], [288].
Instruction-Specific Datasets: This type of dataset is
specifically designed for instruction-based vision-language
models, with samples typically presented as image-instruction-
answer pairs. Its creation follows a similar process to
instruction-following datasets, involving image collection and
conversation generation. As summarized in Table XIV, most
benchmark datasets source their images from open-source
image datasets and leverage methods such as template trans-
formation, assistance from large language models, and human
annotation to produce high-quality conversations. Detailed
methods for conversation generation are provided in Sec-
tion VI-B, while this section focuses on dataset properties,
including task formulations, the number of samples, and
question format. From Table XIV, three key observations
can be made. First, to align with the development trend of
multifunctional capabilities in vision-language models, bench-
mark datasets now include an increasing variety of tasks,
extending beyond common ones like image captioning and
visual question answering. They now encompass more com-
plex reasoning tasks, as well as expansions from single-image
analysis to temporal or cross-view image analysis. Second,
the scale of these datasets is increasing, often comprising
tens of thousands of samples. However, as these samples are
spread across an ever-growing variety of tasks, only a few
hundred samples are typically available for each specific task.
Third, question formats in the datasets can be categorized into
three types: single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended.
For single-choice and multiple-choice questions, each question
is accompanied by a set of candidate answers, facilitating
objective assessment of model performance. In contrast, open-
ended questions allow models to generate answers freely,
closely reflecting real-world scenarios where users may not
know the answer in advance. Below, we present a detailed
discussion of these datasets.
(1) RSIEval [1], VRSBench [12] both focus on common
tasks. RSIEval, which relies entirely on human annotation,
is limited in scale, with only 100 samples for image cap-
tioning and 936 samples for visual question answering. Such
a small dataset may be insufficient for evaluating a model’s
practicality and robustness. In contrast, VRSBench leverages a
semi-automatic creation pipeline, substantially increasing the
dataset size. It contains 29,614, 52,472, and 123,221 samples
for image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question
answering, respectively, with LLaVA-1.5 [49], GeoChat [3],
and GPT-4V achieving the best performance in each task.
(2) FIT-RSRC [11], LHRS-Bench [9] challenge a model’s
capability to understand relationships between objects in im-
ages. Specifically, FIT-RSRC examines the comprehension of
semantic relationships among objects, using terms like “run
along” and “around” to describe these relationships. It features
four types of questions: querying the relationship between two
objects, the existence of a specific relationship, the subject of
a relationship, and the object of a relationship. Furthermore,
each type of question contains unanswerable variants to assess
the model’s robustness and veracity. LHRS-Bot, on the other
hand, targets spatial relationships, describing them using terms
like “top”, “middle” and “bottom”. It also includes tasks such
as object counting, object attribute recognition, image property
recognition, and visual reasoning. However, with only 690
samples in total, and some tasks containing merely a few dozen
samples, its scale is highly inadequate. On these datasets,
SkySenseGPT [11] and LHRS-Bot [9] demonstrate the best
performance, respectively.
(3) COREval [273] expands the evaluation of model capa-
bilities from perception to reasoning. In terms of perception,
it encompasses image-level comprehension, single-instance
identification, and cross-instance discernment. For reasoning,
it emphasizes inferring attributes of scenes or instances, such
as the CO2 emissions or population density of a scene, the
height of a building, or the imaging season of an image.

[link] directs to dataset websites. † indicates that the dataset’s task follows a hierarchical taxonomy. In this table, only the broad dimensions of task design
are displayed, rather than specific tasks.
These two evaluations are divided into 6 sub-dimensions and
22 specific tasks, with a total of 6,263 samples. Recognizing
the significant regional intra-class variations in remote sensing
images, COREval incorporates images sourced from multiple
satellites (Landsat-8, SDGSAT-1, and Sentinel-1/2) and geo-
graphic databases (Google Earth, Natural Earth, and SWIS-
SIMAGE), offering geographic coverage of 50 cities spanning
six continents. On this dataset, 13 open-source vision-language
models from both general and remote sensing domains are
evaluated. The experimental results reveal that while existing
models perform well in image-level comprehension, they
struggle with fine-grained instance perception and complex
reasoning tasks.
(4) VLEO-Bench [34], GEOBench-VLM [274], from the
perspective of remote sensing applications (e.g. urban mon-
itoring and disaster management), integrate remote sensing
image analysis tasks such as temporal analysis of changes,
counting objects, and understanding relationships between
objects. In VLEO-Bench, three types of tasks are included:
scene understanding, which tests a model’s ability to com-
bine high-level image semantics with knowledge expressed in
language; object localization and counting, which evaluates
fine-grained perception; and change detection, which assesses
a model’s capability to identify differences between multi-
ple images. Experimental results on VLEO-Bench show that
although state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V achieve strong
performance in scene understanding, their poor spatial rea-
soning limits their effectiveness in object localization, object
counting, and change detection tasks. GEOBench-VLM, on the
other hand, includes over 10,000 questions across 31 tasks,
categorized into 8 broad categories. Compared to VLEO-
Bench, GEOBench-VLM offers a more diverse range of tasks,
including unique ones like referring expression segmentation
and non-optical imagery analysis. Additionally, unlike VLEO-
Bench, which confines change detection to counting damaged
buildings and estimating damage severity, GEOBench-VLM’s
temporal understanding covers a wider range of tasks. These
include detecting the presence of changes, reasoning about
change causes, assessing disaster impacts, and classifying
crop types based on long-term time-series images. Detailed
experiments with 10 vision-language models show that none
excels across all tasks in GEOBench-VLM. Significant effort
is still required to develop remote sensing-specific models ca-
pable of addressing challenging tasks like referring expression

segmentation.
(5) UrBench [156] concentrates on exploring the potential
applications of vision-language models in urban scenarios. It
comprises 11,600 questions across 14 tasks, spanning four
dimensions: geo-localization, scene reasoning, scene under-
standing, and object understanding. Unlike the previously
mentioned datasets that only include single-view questions in
satellite or aerial images, UrBench also incorporates cross-
view questions, in which each question pairs images of the
same scenario captured from satellite and street views. These
questions involve tasks such as image retrieval, orientation
identification, camera localization, road understanding, object
attribute recognition, and object matching. Meanwhile, they
encompass region-level questions, which examine a model’s
ability to understand urban scenarios at a region level, and
role-level questions, which evaluate its potential to assist
humans in daily life. Experiments with 21 general-purpose
models on UrBench reveal that current models still lag sig-
nificantly behind human experts in urban environments. They
struggle to understand multi-view image relations, and their
performance varies inconsistently across different views.
General-Purpose Datasets: are designed to evaluate var-
ious types of vision-language models. These datasets typically
target specific remote sensing multimodal tasks, with samples
consisting of images and task ground truth presented in
text form. As summarized in [17], commonly used general-
purpose datasets for vision-language model evaluation have
been well-documented. This section, therefore, focuses on
the latest research advancements from the past two years, as
outlined in Table XIV. GeoText-1652 [162] is a language-
guided geo-localization benchmark built on the University-
1652 image dataset [161]. Each image includes detailed image-
level descriptions as well as region-level brief descriptions
with corresponding bounding boxes. DIOR-RSVG [33] is
designed for visual grounding toward remote sensing. Through
an automatic expression generation method, it contains 38,320
image-expression-box triplets. The large scale of this dataset
makes it a popular choice for evaluating vision-language
models. RemoteCount [2] evaluates object counting abilities.
Each image is paired with a human-annotated caption, such
as “a photo of 9 tennis courts”. As a result, this dataset is
small in scale, containing only 947 samples. To meet the
input requirements of contrastive learning-based foundation
models, the original caption is augmented with nine additional
captions by replacing the number in the caption with all
numbers from 1 to 10. SATIN [32] sources images from
27 remote sensing datasets and is designed to evaluate the
classification capabilities of models for satellite images. This
dataset covers six classification tasks: land cover, land use,
hierarchical land use, complex scenes, rare scenes, and false
colour scenes. Among these, the hierarchical land use task
tests the ability to classify land use across varying levels of
granularity, while the complex scene task leverages the large
view fields of remote sensing images to assess the capability
of identifying multiple land use types within a single image.
Experiments with 40 vision-language models on SATIN in
a zero-shot setting show that this dataset poses a significant
challenge, with even models trained on billions of natural
images achieving an accuracy of just over 50%.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
From the perspectives of models and datasets, we have
covered the advancements in vision-language modeling for
remote sensing, knowing how remote sensing images and
natural language can be effectively bridged, which remote
sensing tasks existing vision-language models can address,
and which datasets are suitable for developing and testing
vision-language models. Naturally, this raises two important
questions: 1) Are existing vision-language models adequate
for practical applications? 2) If not, which directions are worth
pursuing to advance this field further? The answer to the
first question is, unsurprisingly, no. Vision-language modeling
remains a highly challenging task and is far from meeting
practical needs. In this section, we aim to share insights on
future research directions from two perspectives: models and
datasets.
Effective representation and alignment for cross-modal
data: A growing trend seeks to advance vision-language
models to accommodate a wide range of remote sensing
images, including optical, SAR, and infrared, thereby enabling
the acquisition of more comprehensive information about the
Earth’s surface [6], [24]. However, in applications such as
disaster risk assessment, these models may need to integrate
additional information sources beyond remote sensing im-
ages, such as geospatial vector data and social media, to
perform complex reasoning [289], [290]. Geospatial vector
data presents complex data structures in the form of points,
polylines, polygons, and networks. Meanwhile, social media
encompasses texts in various languages (e.g., Chinese, English,
and French), diverse types of images (e.g., photographs and
emojis), videos, and more. This complexity and diversity
pose challenges for models in comprehending the embedded
information and associating it with remote sensing data. Con-
sequently, there is a pressing need for effective representation
and alignment across a broader scope of cross-modal data.
Requirements arbitrarily described in natural language:
Existing instructions for prompting vision-language models
are usually definite, such as using task identifiers to specify
particular remote sensing tasks [3], [5] or providing candidate
answers [9]. However, in more realistic and practical scenarios,
requirements described in natural language tend to be vague
and complex, involving the sequential execution of multiple
tasks. For example, given an instruction like “Please assess the
water quality in the indicated area of the image”, the model
must be capable of decomposing water quality assessment into
two sub-tasks: water detection and quantitative retrieval, and
then accomplish each task in sequence. This creates the need
to advance further models’ language understanding capability
to adapt to users’ arbitrary or flexible demands.
Enhancing the reliability of model answers via expert
explanations: Existing vision-language models take language
instructions and visual representations as input, producing im-
age analysis results in the form of natural language. However,
these models typically do not provide expert explanations for
their answers, leading users to doubt the reliability of the


===== PAGE 28 =====
28
outputs, especially in tasks requiring complex reasoning rather
than simple recognition. For instance, in precision agriculture,
where the model may be used to guide pesticide spraying
schedules, the lack of explanations regarding crop diseases
and pest conditions makes it hard to convince farmers to fol-
low the recommendations. Consequently, expert explanations
accompanying image analysis results are necessary, as they
not only enhance the reliability and interpretability of the
model’s answers but also offer insight into the decision-making
process, thereby fostering user trust. A recent initiative [142]
has begun exploring the feasibility of developing the vision-
language model capable of performing fine-grained ship clas-
sification while providing reasoning behind its classification.
This is accomplished by integrating domain knowledge into
the construction of the instruction-following dataset.
Continually adapting vision-language models: It is well
known that new remote sensing images are collected daily
from around the world, and human demands may change
accordingly. This necessitates continually adapting vision-
language models to these dynamic changes, rather than relying
solely on one-time pre-training and fine-tuning. Combining
newly collected data with previously gathered data for con-
tinual learning is a straightforward and effective approach.
However, the growing volume of data poses significant chal-
lenges in terms of computational and storage costs. Training
the model exclusively on new data risks catastrophic forget-
ting [291], [292]. Therefore, it is crucial for the research
community to explore effective learning strategies that enable
vision-language models to learn new knowledge from new data
while maintaining old knowledge.
More diverse and rich remote sensing multimodal
dataset: The original CLIP model was trained on 400 million
image-text pairs, whereas the largest remote sensing pre-
training dataset (Git-10M [293]) contains only 10 million
pairs, predominantly limited to optical images. This data
scarcity restricts models’ capacity to capture a broad range
of visual concepts, a challenge that is particularly pressing
in remote sensing. Variations in imaging conditions, sensor
parameters, and geographic locations result in highly varied vi-
sual characteristics of objects in remote sensing images [100].
Therefore, substantial efforts are required to create image-text
datasets that encompass diverse ground objects and a rich
variety of remote sensing image modalities.
Challenging and application-specific benchmarks: Most
benchmark datasets [1], [12] for model evaluation are lim-
ited to a narrow range of remote sensing tasks (e.g., visual
question answering and image captioning), whereas contem-
porary vision-language models [11], [202], [213] in remote
sensing demonstrate versatile capabilities across diverse image
analysis tasks. Furthermore, while some benchmarks include
multiple tasks [273], [274], each task typically has a limited
number of samples. Such datasets are insufficient for thor-
oughly testing and comparing the performance of different
vision-language models. Beyond general-purpose benchmarks,
exploring application-specific benchmarks is also a promising
research direction, as some efforts have focused on developing
versatile vision-language models tailored to specific real-world
applications [24], [142].
