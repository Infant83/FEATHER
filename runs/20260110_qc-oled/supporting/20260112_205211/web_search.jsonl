Calculations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms on the statevector simulator accurately reproduced the results from exact diagonalization and provided reliable prediction of ΔEST which are in good agreement with experiments. These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters. [...] Our work showcases the use of quantum hardware to simulate excited states of an important class of industrial materials, TADF emitters, by utilizing an active space Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that by combining our proposed error mitigation scheme with quantum algorithms, current quantum devices could be of practical use for the prediction of the properties of interest. Since the state tomography purification approach used in our proposed scheme can be extended to systems requiring large number of qubits by purifying the quantum state using a computationally inexpensive iterative approach24.\"), or by applying quantum principal component analysis25.\"), or variational quantum state diagonalization26.\"), we believe that the extension of our proposed scheme will, in principle, be well [...] Although qEOM-VQE and VQD use different strategies to calculate excited states, both predict very similar energies for the S1 and T1 states.

Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost [...] orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity.", "score": 0.48030865, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06036", "title": "State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized VQE: A quantum algorithm for the ...", "content": "# State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized VQE: A quantum algorithm for the democratic description of ground and excited electronic states\n\nJupyter Notebook Python Submitted 26 July 2023 • Published 26 September 2024\n\nSoftware repository   Paper review   Download paper   Software archive\n\nReview\n\nEditor: @Kevin-Mattheus-Moerman (all papers)  \nReviewers: @alejandrogallo (all reviews), @erikkjellgren (all reviews), @plewandowska777 (all reviews), @TariniHardikar (all reviews), @berquist (all reviews)\n\nAuthors\n\nMartin Beseda (0000-0001-5792-2872), Silvie Illésová (0009-0002-5231-3714), Saad Yalouz (0000-0002-8818-3379), Bruno Senjean (0000-0003-1706-015X)\n\nCitation [...] Citation\n\nBeseda et al., (2024).

Both computational codes will start in parallel. While CP2K starts out by finding a low-level solution to the entire system (SCF), Qiskit can use this time to perform certain preparational tasks that are unique to the execution of quantum computing hardware and do not require problem-specific data. For both programs, the user has full flexibility to leverage their respective capabilities during these initial steps.
