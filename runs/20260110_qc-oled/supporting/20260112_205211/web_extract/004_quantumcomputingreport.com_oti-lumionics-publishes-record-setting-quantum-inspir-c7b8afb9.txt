OTI Lumionics Publishes Paper on Record-Setting Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for OLED Materials Simulation

[OTI Lumionics](https://otilumionics.com/) has unveiled a major advancement in quantum-inspired chemistry simulations, demonstrating that highly accurate quantum electronic structure calculations can now be performed on classical hardware. The breakthrough, described in the [Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00345), introduces a new method for optimizing deep Qubit Coupled Cluster (QCC) circuits, allowing simulations of real-world molecules at scales previously limited to future quantum computers.

While quantum hardware remains constrained by qubit quality and gate fidelity, OTI’s research presents a hybrid quantum-classical framework that efficiently optimizes quantum circuits with up to 80 algorithmic qubits and over a million entangling gates. The approach enables full simulation on modest classical infrastructure—reportedly 24 CPUs in under 24 hours—covering challenging molecular targets like Ir(F₂ppy)₃, a key emitter compound in OLED displays. The result demonstrates not only computational efficiency, but also high fidelity in predicting electronic states critical for materials design.

OTI’s work offers a scalable, practical solution for industrial materials discovery pipelines that need quantum precision today without waiting for fault-tolerant quantum computers. It specifically accelerates OLED R&D by simulating excited-state dynamics with greater accuracy than traditional ab initio methods. The paper’s authors include VP of Materials Discovery Scott Genin, alongside researchers Ilya G. Ryabinkin and Seyyed Mehdi Hosseini Jenab.
