The mixing of singlet and triplet states is essential to obtain efficient exciton harvesting. 𝐻𝑆𝑂, which is crucial for the metal complexes (second generation of emitters), is small for purely organic molecules. However, with a sufficiently small Δ𝐸𝑆𝑇, the ISC and RISC processes can occur. Figure 10: Chemical structure (left). X-ray structure (center) and calculated HOMO (blue)/LUMO (red) (right) for the blue TADF emitter SpiroAC-TRZ. Adapted from ref.73 1.5. Host materials Even though TADF emitting materials exhibit good efficiencies, [...] get access to the remaining 75% of excitons in the triplet state, heavy-metal complexes have been investigated and developed as emitters for the second generation of OLEDs. Baldo et al., in 1998, reported the first example of a platinum complex that delivered an IQE of 23%.55 Successively, in 2001, the first heavy metal-based emitters (iridium and platinum complexes) with an IQE of nearly 100% were reported by Adachi et al.,56 which were far above the 25% limit of the first generation. Basically, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling induced by heavy metal atoms (such as iridium or platinum) facilitates the intersystem crossing (kISC) from the S1 state to the T1 state,25,51,55,57 and the emission of phosphorescence within a useful millisecond regime. Some examples of second-generation emitters [...] of the newly synthesized hosts are determined, along with the HOMO and LUMO values. Finally, the most promising host, 1MPA, was used to fabricate blue OLEDs (Paper 2). The thermal and morphological properties of materials are essential not just for hosts but also for emitter molecules. These materials must be thermally stable during the evaporation process and morphologically stable, especially when they are present in high doping concentrations in the emitting layer. A complete thermal characterization was carried out on a series of new TADF emitters to determine their suitability for OLED devices (Paper 3). Thermal properties affect not just the processing of materials and the stability of devices. An essential parameter for OLEDs is the external quantum efficiency.

[...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones.
