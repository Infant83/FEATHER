For the simulation of the MS = 1 state, the resulting qubit Hamiltonian acts on four qubits and there are two variational parameters in the UCCSD ansatz. For the simulation of the MS = 0 state, we fixed the occupation of the a orbital and the resulting qubit Hamiltonian acts on 2 qubits. We replicated the exponential excitation operator twice, with parameters in both replicas variationally optimized. Such a choice results in six variational parameters, providing a sufficient number of degrees of freedom for an accurate representation of the strongly-correlated MS = 0 state. Parameters in the ansatz are optimized with the COBYLA algorithm86.\"). [...] We then performed VQE simulations with a quantum simulator and with the IBM Q 5 Yorktown quantum computer47. We estimated the energy of the 3A2 ground state manifold by performing VQE calculations for both the single-Slater-determinant MS = 1 component and the strongly-correlated MS = 0 component. Within a molecular orbital notation, MS = 1 and MS = 0 ground states can be represented as \\(\\left|a\\bar{a}{e}\\_{x}{e}\\_{y}\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|a\\bar{a}{e}\\_{x}{\\bar{e}}\\_{y}\\right\\rangle +\\left|a\\bar{a}{\\bar{e}}\\_{x}{e}\\_{y}\\right\\rangle \\right)\\), respectively, where a, ex, ey (spin-up) and \\(\\bar{a}\\), \\({\\bar{e}}\\_{x}\\), \\({\\bar{e}}\\_{y}\\) (spin-down) denote a1 and e orbitals.

We used unitary coupled-cluster single and double (UCCSD) ansatzes49.\") to represent the trial wavefunctions. Fig. 3b and c shows the estimated ground state energy as a function of the number of VQE iterations, where VQE calculations performed with the quantum simulator correctly converges to the ground state energy in both the MS = 1 and MS = 0 case.

These algorithms were developed specifically to compute excited states of molecules, such as the singlet and triplet excited states of the PSPCz molecules of interest to the study. In a singlet state, all electrons in a system are spin paired, giving them only one possible orientation in space. In a triplet state, one set of electron spins is unpaired, meaning there are three possible orientations in space with respect to the axis. [...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones. [...] We applied qubit reduction techniques to simulate the transition amplitudes of interest to this study. We reduced the number of spatial orbitals to those absolutely necessary to describe the excitation processes under investigation and focused on transitions involving an active space comprising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for each molecule. That strategy enabled us to reduce the number of qubits to just two after applying spin parity reduction.\n\n## Quantum Chemistry Simulations on IBM Quantum Devices", "score": 0.8458536, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-12-ibm-delivers-new-quantum-processors,-software,-and-algorithm-breakthroughs-on-path-to-advantage-and-fault-tolerance", "title": "IBM Delivers New Quantum Processors, Software, and Algorithm ...", "content": "# All press releases\n\n# IBM Delivers New Quantum Processors, Software, and Algorithm Breakthroughs on Path to Advantage and Fault Tolerance\n\nYORKTOWN HEIGHTS, New York – November 12, 2025 – At the annual Quantum Developer Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled fundamental progress on its path to delivering both quantum advantage by the end of 2026 and fault-tolerant quantum computing by 2029.\n\n“There are many pillars to bringing truly useful quantum computing to the world,” said Jay Gambetta, Director of IBM Research and IBM Fellow. “We believe that IBM is the only company that is positioned to rapidly invent and scale quantum software, hardware, fabrication, and error correction to unlock transformative applications.

Now, the quantum community is starting to make its first credible advantage claims.\n\nEarlier this year, we published a framework for rigorously gauging how and when we’ll have entered the advantage era. Today, we’re at an exciting juncture in the history of this technology. We're already seeing examples of enterprises building potentially useful quantum-powered alternatives to production classical solutions. At the same time, theorists are seeking rigorous proofs of advantage by verifying quantum circuit implementations against trustworthy classical methods. [...] ## Quantum advantage together\n\nThis year brought more than new capabilities. Quantum advantages are emerging, and improving hardware will lead to definitive speed-ups over classical computing. New software tools will take those advantages and allow users to implement them in algorithms, and run those algorithms across integrated quantum and classical resources. As we continue to deliver on our roadmap, we’re confident that the community will bring quantum-centric supercomputing into reality.
