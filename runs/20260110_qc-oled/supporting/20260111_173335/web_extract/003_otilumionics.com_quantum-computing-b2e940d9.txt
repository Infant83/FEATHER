# Enabling quantum computing for materials discovery.

Our team of theoreticians, quantum chemists, computer scientists and software engineers are building powerful quantum and quantum-inspired software to solve the most complex problems in materials science and chemistry.

### Quantum computing for materials discovery

Quantum computing has the potential to disrupt nearly every industry with exponential performance gains over classical computing. Our team is applying quantum methods to improve our [Materials Discovery Platform](https://otilumionics.com/materials-discovery/).

* Faster materials simulations
* More accurate property predictions
* Excited states mapping
* Chemical reaction modeling
* Molecular geometry
* Strong electron correlation
