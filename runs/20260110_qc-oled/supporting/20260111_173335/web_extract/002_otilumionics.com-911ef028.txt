### Integrated Materials Development

At OTI Lumionics we are developing advanced materials—by design—using [quantum simulations](https://otilumionics.com/quantum-computing/), machine learning and real-world testing in pilot production. We are currently focused on key enabling materials for OLED displays that will be used in next-generation consumer electronics and automotive. Our advanced electrode materials, and associated manufacturing technology, are being used to build [transparent displays](https://otilumionics.com/transparent-displays/) and lighting.

We work closely with our partners and customers to design new materials that are mass-production ready. Using our computational [Materials Discovery Platform,](https://otilumionics.com/materials-discovery/) we are able to rapidly iterate new materials, allowing fast turn around time to meet our customers’ needs.

Our materials are vigorously tested to our customers’ exacting specifications, using our in-house pilot production facility for thin-film electronics. Scale-up and mass production supply of our materials is provided by our network of Tier 1 chemical and materials partners.

Between our in-house facilities, and industrial and academic partners, we offer the following capabilities:

* Computational materials design
* Materials synthesis + scale-up
* Testing in pilot production testing
* Application engineering + prototyping

###### Computational Chemistry

High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning (AI) remove the guesswork.

* Screen 1,000x more candidates
* Precision property design
* Lower development cost
* Faster development cycle
