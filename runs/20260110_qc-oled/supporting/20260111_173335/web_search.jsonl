Differences of 17 and 88 mHa with respect to exact energies were found for excited states by using the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively, to perform simulations on quantum devices without error mitigation. By utilizing state tomography to purify the quantum states and correct energy values, the large errors found for unmitigated results could be improved to differences of, at most, 4 mHa with respect to exact values.

In the new arXiv pre-print, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we — along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR — describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. [...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones. [...] ## Active Space Reduction\n\nWe studied the PSPCz electronic transitions of the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states using two quantum algorithms – the quantum Equation-Of-Motion Variational Quantum Eigensolver (qEOM-VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD). These algorithms were developed specifically to compute excited states of molecules, such as the singlet and triplet excited states of the PSPCz molecules of interest to the study. In a singlet state, all electrons in a system are spin paired, giving them only one possible orientation in space. In a triplet state, one set of electron spins is unpaired, meaning there are three possible orientations in space with respect to the axis.", "score": 0.53648347, "raw_content": null}, {"title": "2024 2025 2026 2027 2029 2033+ - IBM", "url": "https://www.ibm.com/roadmaps/quantum.pdf", "content": "Scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing to 1 billion gates on up to 2000 qubits with a power consumption of 2 megawatts will require a new control elections and cryogenics infrastructure.

The VQE algorithm is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, making it a promising candidate for use in many applications of quantum computers, including machine learning and control theory . One particularly useful application of the VQE algorithm is finding the ground state energy (i.e., the minimum eigenvalue) of a Hamiltonian.

It is based on PQCs that approximate the adiabatic evolution from an initial Hamiltonian. A set of parameters are tweaked to optimize a cost function out of the quantum circuit output. The QAOA method is a promising candidate for achieving quantum advantage over classical systems in the NISQ era.

The library provides a unified architecture for near-term quantum computing devices, supporting both qubit and continuous-variable paradigms. PennyLane's core feature is the ability to compute gradients of variational quantum circuits in a way that is compatible with classical techniques such as backpropagation. PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms common in optimization and machine learning to include quantum and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for hardware providers including the Xanadu Cloud, Amazon Braket, and IBM Quantum, allowing PennyLane [...] Cloud, Amazon Braket, and IBM Quantum, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible quantum devices. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Autograd. PennyLane can be used for the optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, quantum machine learning models, and many other applications.
