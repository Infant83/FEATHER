These algorithms were developed specifically to compute excited states of molecules, such as the singlet and triplet excited states of the PSPCz molecules of interest to the study. In a singlet state, all electrons in a system are spin paired, giving them only one possible orientation in space. In a triplet state, one set of electron spins is unpaired, meaning there are three possible orientations in space with respect to the axis. [...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones. [...] We applied qubit reduction techniques to simulate the transition amplitudes of interest to this study. We reduced the number of spatial orbitals to those absolutely necessary to describe the excitation processes under investigation and focused on transitions involving an active space comprising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for each molecule.

Calculations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms on the statevector simulator accurately reproduced the results from exact diagonalization and provided reliable prediction of ΔEST which are in good agreement with experiments. These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters.

In the new arXiv pre-print, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we — along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR — describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. [...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones. [...] ## Quantum Chemistry Simulations on IBM Quantum Devices\n\nThe qEOM-VQE and VQD calculations were run on ibmq\\_boeblingen and ibmq\\_singapore devices. An important part of our research focused on determining how two different error mitigation techniques — readout error mitigation and quantum-state tomography — could allow us to accurately compute the excited state energies and transitions of the TADF emitters of interest on today’s quantum computers.", "score": 0.6172364, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00834-3", "title": "Deep learning for development of organic optoelectronic devices", "content": "Article \n   CAS \n   Google Scholar\n3.
