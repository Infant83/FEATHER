A quantum chemistry study of the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states of phenylsulfonyl-
carbazole compounds, proposed as useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for 
organic light emitting diode (OLED) applications, was performed with the quantum Equation-Of-Motion 
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (qEOM-VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithms on 
quantum simulators and devices. These quantum simulations were performed with double zeta quality 
basis sets on an active space comprising the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals 
(HOMO, LUMO) of the TADF molecules. The differences in energy separations between S1 and T1 (∆𝐸!") 
predicted by calculations on quantum simulators were found to be in excellent agreement with 
experimental data. Differences of 16 and 88 mHa with respect to exact energies were found for excited 
states by using the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively, to perform simulations on quantum 
devices without error mitigation. By utilizing error mitigation by state tomography to purify the quantum 
states and correct energy values, the large errors found for unmitigated results could be improved to 
differences of, at most, 3 mHa with respect to exact values. Consequently, excellent agreement could be 
found between values of ∆𝐸!" predicted by quantum simulations and those found in experiments.

structure methods used for quantum chemical 
calculations on classical computing architecture is 

 
2 
the difficulty of finding eigenvalues of eigenvectors of 
the electronic Hamiltonian. [1] The advent of 
quantum computing, which has demonstrated 
tremendous synergistic advances in both hardware 
and software capabilities in recent years, may 
provide invaluable support in the investigation of the 
electronic structure of molecules and materials, 
especially with regards to dynamical properties. 
However, quantum computing is still, in many ways, 
a nascent technology, and quantum devices are 
currently 
hamstrung 
by 
noisiness 
and 
short 
decoherence times. Thus, quantum algorithms, such 
as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) 
algorithm, [2] are currently being used to find 
eigenvalues for approximate Ansätze suitable for 
constructing relatively short circuits that can be used 
for quantum chemistry calculations. [3]  
 A number of quantum computing use cases for 
chemistry have been investigated on quantum 
devices in the recent past. One of the first 
applications highlighted the construction of ground 
state dissociation profiles of hydrogen, lithium 
hydride and beryllium hydride via computation using 
an IBM Q quantum device. [3] Researchers have also 
performed computational studies on the mechanism 
of the rearrangement of the lithium superoxide dimer 
using larger devices. [4] In the latter case, the orbital 
determinants 
of 
the 
stationary 
points 
were 
extensively examined to identify a suitable orbital 
active space for which a reduced number of qubits 
could be used for computation given the current 
limitations of these devices. Simulations performed 
on classical hardware reproduced calculations 
involving the exact eigensolver known as Full 
Configuration Interaction (Full CI or FCI) for this 
process. 
However, 
calculations 
performed 
on 
quantum devices using hardware efficient Ansätze 
such as Ry were less capable of reproducing exact 
energies due to noise.  
 In addition to using the VQE algorithm to 
compute energies for the dissociation profiles of 
molecules and the potential energy surfaces for 
reactions, various algorithms, among them the 
Quantum Equation-of-Motion VQE (qEOM-VQE) [5] 
and 
Variational 
Quantum 
Deflation 
(VQD) 
algorithms [6], have been developed in order to 
compute excited states of molecules. In particular, 
Ollitrault et al. have demonstrated computation of the 
first three excited states on the dissociation profile for 
lithium hydride on IBM Quantum hardware. [5] 
 Here, we take an initial step towards the 
application of algorithms such as qEOM-VQE and 
VQD to determine excitation energies of industrially 
relevant molecules. The subject of this study is 
thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) 
emitters suitable for organic light emitting diode 
(OLED) 
applications. [7] 
Once 
the 
separation 
between the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited 
states (∆𝐸!" ) is sufficiently small, non-emissive T1 
excitons can be thermally excited to an emissive S1 
state, providing the emission mechanism of TADF 
emitters. The mechanism enables OLED devices 
comprised of TADF emitters to potentially perform 
with 100% internal quantum efficiency, in contrast to 
devices comprising conventional fluorophores for 
which the quantum efficiencies are inherently limited 
to 25%. TADF emitters have been demonstrated as 
next-generation emission materials for a range of 
fluorophores and have been utilized in the fabrication 
of efficient OLEDs. [7–12] 
 To date there have been a number of 
computational studies on predictions of ∆𝐸!" to aid in 
the design of novel TADF materials. [12–17] Based 
on those investigations, a well-established strategy 
for designing TADF molecules involves identifying 
emitters in which HOMO and LUMO are spatially 
separated and localized on appropriate moieties. 
Previous demonstrations have shown that a series of 
phenylsulfonyl-9H-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules are 
useful as TADF emitters due to the fact that the ∆𝐸!" 

 
3 
of these molecules can be finely tuned by modifying 
their electronic properties. [18] We have elected to 
perform quantum chemical investigations on the 
molecules, PSPCz, 2F-PSPCz, 4F-PSPCz (Figure 
1), using quantum devices and simulators.  
 
Fig 1. Molecular structures of the PSPCz, 2F-PSPCz and 
4F-PSPCz molecules. 
 Notably, all three molecules of interest require 
the use of many more qubits than are currently 
available on useful quantum hardware or that can be 
reliably simulated using classical architecture. Thus, 
qubit reduction techniques must be applied in order 
to simulate the transition amplitudes of interest to this 
study. We have reduced the number of spatial 
orbitals to those that are absolutely necessary to 
describe the processes under investigation and have 
thus focused on transitions involving the HOMO and 
LUMO active space for each molecule. This strategy 
has allowed reduction of the number of qubits to just 
two after applying spin parity reduction.   
 Simulations of the qEOM-VQE and VQD 
algorithms were performed on classical devices using 
heuristic Ansätze, in order to assess the accuracy of 
these techniques. Particular attention was paid to 
comparisons with experimental data  [18] which 
indicate that these procedures produce meaningful 
data for predicting the ∆𝐸!"  of TADF emitters. 
Moreover, we have shown that these simulations can 
provide a detailed picture about how structural 
variation in phenylsulfonyl/carbazole molecules tunes 
the S1 and T1 excitations. Finally, we have found that 
simulations performed on a quantum device without 
error mitigation were much less reliable than results 
provided by quantum simulators. This is attributed to 
the fact that the quantum state of the ground state 
predicted on devices is a mixed state.  
 We have examined various strategies to solve 
this issue and have found that the most accurate 
procedure involves the use of state tomography to 
purify the mixed ground state obtained from the 
quantum device prior to application of readout error 
mitigation to the calculation involving the excited 
state. We note that since the state tomography 
purification approach can, in principle, be applied to 
other methods for computing excited states on 
quantum computers  [19,20], and can be extended to 
systems requiring large number of qubits by purifying 
the 
quantum 
state 
using 
a 
computationally 
inexpensive iterative approach, [21] or by applying 
quantum principal component analysis, [22] or 
variational quantum state diagonalization, [23] we 
believe that it can be generally useful for quantum 
chemistry simulations of excited states on near-term 
quantum devices. 
 
Methods  
Four computational steps were performed in 
order to evaluate the electronic transitions between 
the singlet and triplet excited states of the PSPCz 
molecules: (i) structural optimization on classical 
architecture, (ii) computation of ground state (GS) 
energies on quantum simulators and quantum  
devices utilizing the HOMO-LUMO active space, (iii) 
error mitigation applied to ground state energies 
obtained from quantum devices, (iv) computation of 
the first singlet and triplet excited states (S1 and T1), 
using quantum simulators and quantum devices.  
Optimized geometries of the first triplet excited 
state (T1) of all PSPCz molecules were generated 
using the TDDFT routines contained in the 
Gaussian16 computational suite of programs [24] 
using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and basis 
set. The Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) [25], 
which has been reported to be accurate for the 
calculation 
of 
triplet 
excited 
states [26], 
was 
employed for all TDDFT calculations. For the sake of 
simplicity, the optimized geometries of the T1 excited 

 
4 
states were used for both the S1 and T1 excited states 
based on the fact that the HOMO-LUMO overlap (i.e. 
exchange integral) in TADF molecules is so small that 
the properties of the S1 and T1 states should be quite 
similar, except for the spin component, and the 
structures of these excited states should also be 
similar.  
The HOMO and LUMO was chosen as the active 
space for calculating the ground state (S0), and S1 
and T1 excited states because the HOMO and LUMO 
of the target molecules are spatially fairly well-
separated as shown in Figure 2, and both the S1 and 
T1 states can be well described by a transition arising 
from the HOMO, with atomic orbitals localized on the 
carbazole moiety, to the LUMO, with atomic orbitals 
localized on the diarylsulfone (ArSO2Ar-) moieties.

optimized structures of PSPCz, 2F-PSPCz and 4F-PSPCz, 
respectively. 
Calculations were performed to obtain ground 
state energies on quantum simulators and devices by 
utilizing the VQE algorithm and the Ry heuristic 
Ansätze with a circuit depth equal to 1. Energies were 
computed using the STO-3G minimal basis set and 
the split-level double zeta basis set 6-31G(d). The 
parity mapping technique [27], which allows the 
number of qubits to be reduced by two, was used to 
map molecular spin-orbitals to qubits. The Aqua 
module contained in Qiskit version 0.14  [28] with an 
interface to the PySCF [29] program was used for all 
VQE calculations. 
Calculations 
were 
performed 
using 
the 
statevector and qasm simulators contained in the 
Aer module of Qiskit, as well as on the 
ibmq_boeblingen and ibmq_singapore 20-
qubit quantum devices. The statevector simulator 
computes wavefunctions and expectation values 
exactly, by means of linear algebra operations. In 
contrast, the qasm simulator samples quantum 
mechanical probability distributions that can be 
determined exactly by means of linear algebra 
operations, or by approximating actual decoherence 
processes occurring on hardware when used with 
noise models. The user specifies the number of 
statistical samples, or shots, drawn from the target 
probability distribution when using the qasm 
simulator.  
The Sequential Least SQuares Programming 
(SLSQP) method [30], which uses the exact gradient 
for energy minimization and has been found to 
provide 
accurate 
predictions 
without 
noise 
present, [31] was used for calculations using the 
statevector 
simulator. 
The 
Simultaneous 
Perturbation 
Stochastic 
Approximation 
(SPSA) [32,33] method, which is a good optimizer in 
the presence of noise, [34] was used for calculations 
on quantum devices.  
The readout error mitigation and quantum state 
tomography techniques provided in Qiskit were used 
to mitigate errors in the generation of variational 
parameters, q, and ground state energies.  
The four basis states of the two-qubit system, 
namely |00>, |01>, |10> and |11>, were measured for 
the readout error mitigation technique. A vector with 
the probability for the four basis states was created 
for every measurement, and the combination of all 
four vectors resulted in the formation of a 4x4 matrix 
from which a calibration matrix was generated by 
least-squares fitting. The calibration matrix was 
applied to the measurement of Pauli terms in the VQE 
calculation to correct the energy value of ground 
state. The values of q in Ry were then calculated 
using a classical optimizer..

qubits. 
 
The quantum state tomography technique 
involves purification of the state by diagonalizing the 
density matrix and selection of the pure state with the 
maximum eigenvalue resulting from this process. The 
ground state energy is then refined by computing the 
expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to 
the obtained pure state. The Ry q values 
corresponding to the purified ground state were 
determined by fitting the vector of the Ansätze to the 
purified maximum eigenstate. Figure 3 shows that the 
Ry circuit for the two-qubit system produces an output 
state Y(q) that can be represented as a linear 
combination of the four basis states |00>, |01>, |10> 
and |11>, with coefficients given by Equation 1. 
Note that 300 iterations were performed without 
error mitigation prior to application of the readout 
error mitigation or quantum state tomography 
techniques to obtain a quantum state which is close 
to the ground state generated without noise. The 
optimized parameters obtained from VQE without 
error mitigation was used as the initial state for VQE 
calculations combined with readout error mitigation, 
and the optimized wavefunction was determined by 
using previously published protocols. [34] The 
optimized wavefunction obtained from the use of 
quantum state tomography was determined by using 
the density matrix of the final result obtained from 
VQE without error mitigation contained in the 
tomography module of the Ignis element of Qiskit. 
The optimized wavefunction found by application 
of the readout error mitigation and quantum state 
tomography techniques to ground states computed 
with VQE were used to compute the energies of the 
S1 and T1 excited states by the use of the qEOM-
VQE [5] and VQD  [6,31] algorithms. The values of 
matrix elements of the EOM (equation of motion) 
were computed on quantum devices using the 
qEOM-VQE algorithm with the GS obtained from 
VQE as the reference state. The matrix was then 
diagonalized on a classical computer and the first and 
second eigenvalues regarded as the en
