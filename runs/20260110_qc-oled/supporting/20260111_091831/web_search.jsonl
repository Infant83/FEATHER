Scientist at Mitsubishi Chemical and IBM initiated a joint research project with collaborators at JSR and Keio University to calculate the excited states of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which are applied to the fabrication of efficient OLEDs. The parties have developed a new scheme to mitigate the error from current noisy quantum computers and succeeded in improving the calculation accuracy. This is the world-first research case of applying quantum computers to excited states calculations of commercial materials. We expect the proposed error mitigation scheme, together with the [...] Reference <Co-authors> - Qi Gao, Takao Kobayashi, and Eriko Watanabe, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation Science & Innovation Center - Hajime Nakamura, IBM Research-Tokyo - Gavin O.

In the new arXiv pre-print, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we — along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR — describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. [...] Looking ahead, our ability to both pare down the active space and apply error-mitigation to obtain accurate results is a reassuring indication that the chemicals industry can use today’s quantum computers to do meaningful research. We will continue to investigate ways to expand active spaces through more efficient algorithms and to test the scalability limits of quantum-state tomography as IBM Research explores new improvements that lead to more robust next-generation quantum devices.\n\nIBM Quantum: Tomorrow's computing today\n\nQuantum starts here\n\n## Related posts\n\n ### IBM Research Ireland moves to the heart of Dublin with a new lab at Trinity College Dublin\n\n  News\n\n  Mike Murphy", "score": 0.7429634, "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 4.26, "request_id": "1bf1b174-d308-43a8-8b62-ec4ae718575b"}, "timestamp": 1768090727.597786}
