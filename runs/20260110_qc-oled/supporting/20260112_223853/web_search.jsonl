While ground states of small molecular systems are typically explored using hybrid variational algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the study of excited states has received much less attention, partly due to the absence of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce the subspace search quantum imaginary time evolution (SSQITE) method, which calculates excited states using [...] mechanistic studies of catalytic systems.24 This has driven significant interest in generalizing ground state algorithms, such as VQE and VarQITE, to excited states of quantum systems. Notable algorithms designed for this purpose include the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE)25 and the variational quantum deflation (VQD)22 algorithm. The VQD approach22 has been applied to calculations at Frank−Condon and the conical intersection geometries,26 and has been adapted to VarQITE27,28 for determining excited states.", "score": 0.36012948, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.2c01053", "title": "Calculation of Core-Excited & Ionized States: VQD & Photocatalysis", "content": "Recently Viewedclose modal)\n\n ACS\n ACS Publications\n C&EN\n CAS\n\nLog In\n\nPublications\n\n## CONTENT TYPES\n\n## SUBJECTS\n\nPublications: All Types\n\n# An Error Occurred Setting Your User Cookie\n\nThis site uses cookies to improve performance.

Variational quantum deflation (VQD) is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for the calculation of excited states with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Although the validity of this method has been demonstrated, there have been few practical applications, primarily because of the uncertain effect of calculation conditions on the results. In the present study, calculations of the core-excited and core-ionized states for common molecules based on the VQD method were examined using a classical computer, focusing on the effects of the weighting coefficients applied in the penalty terms of the cost function. Adopting a simplified procedure for estimating the weighting [...] a simplified procedure for estimating the weighting coefficients based on molecular orbital levels allowed these core-level states to be successfully calculated. The O 1s core-ionized state for a water molecule was calculated with various weighting coefficients, and the resulting ansatz states were systematically examined. The application of this technique to functional materials was demonstrated by calculating the core-level states for titanium dioxide (TiO2) and nitrogen-doped TiO2 models. The results demonstrate that VQD calculations employing an appropriate cost function can be applied to the analysis of functional materials in conjunction with an experimental approach.", "score": 0.31406155, "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 3.8, "request_id": "28a61c0f-da6e-4d5d-ba16-6bfd09e9f5d4"}, "timestamp": 1768225143.2775726}

Calculations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms on the statevector simulator accurately reproduced the results from exact diagonalization and provided reliable prediction of ΔEST which are in good agreement with experiments. These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters. [...] Here, we take an initial step towards the application of algorithms such as VQE, qEOM-VQE, and VQD to determine ground and excited state energies of industrially relevant molecules. The subject of this study is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters suitable for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications9.\"). Once the separation between the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states (ΔEST) of such molecules is sufficiently small, non-emissive T1 excitons can be thermally excited to an emissive S1 state, providing the emission mechanism of TADF emitters. The mechanism enables OLED devices comprised of TADF emitters to potentially perform with 100% internal quantum efficiency, in contrast to devices comprising conventional fluorophores for which the quantum", "score": 0.69573146, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-00965-1", "title": "Excited state calculations using variational quantum eigensolver ...", "content": "Skip to main content\n\nDownload PDF\n\n Article\n Open access\n Published:\n\n# Excited state calculations using variational quantum eigensolver with spin-restricted ansätze and automatically-adjusted constraints\n\n Shigeki Gocho1,2,\n Hajime Nakamura \n  ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-7634-83752,3,\n Shu Kanno \n  ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-8543-82092,4,\n Qi Gao \n  ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-7528-15622,4,\n Takao Kobayashi2,4,\n Taichi Inagaki \n  ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-8112-64191,2 &\n …\n Miho Hatanaka \n  ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-9908-78601,2\n\nnpj Computational Materials\nvolume 9, Article number: 13 (2023)\nCite this article\n\n 9833 Accesses\n 35 Citations\n 38 Altmetric\n Metrics details\n\n## Abstract [...] Reprints and permissions\n\n## About this article\n\n### Cite this article\n\nGocho, S., Nakamura, H., Kanno, S. et al.

This method is called VQD37.\"),38.\"). The definition of the cost function depends on the target state, as well as the target system. For instance, the cost function, C1(θ), for the first excited state can be defined as follows:\n\n$$C\\_1\\left( {{{\\mathbf{\\theta }}}} \\right) = \\left\\langle {{\\Psi}\\left( {{{\\mathbf{\\theta }}}} \\right)\\left| {\\hat H} \\right|{\\Psi}\\left( {{{\\mathbf{\\theta }}}} \\right)} \\right\\rangle + \\beta \\left| {\\left\\langle {{\\Psi}\\left( {{{\\mathbf{\\theta }}}} \\right)\\left| {{\\Psi}\\_0} \\right.} \\right\\rangle } \\right|^2,$$\n\n(2)", "score": 0.6922474, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://research.ibm.com/publications/excited-state-calculations-using-variational-quantum-eigensolver-with-spin-restricted-ansatze-and-automatically-adjusted-constraints", "title": "Excited state calculations using variational quantum eigensolver ...", "content": "The ground and excited state calculations at key geometries, such as the Frank–Condon (FC) and the conical intersection (CI) geometries, are essential for understanding photophysical properties. To compute these geometries on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we proposed a strategy that combined a chemistry-inspired spin-restricted ansatz and a new excited state calculation method called the variational quantum eigensolver under automatically-adjusted constraints (VQE/AC). Unlike the conventional excited state calculation method, called the variational quantum deflation, the VQE/AC does not require the pre-determination of constraint weights and has the potential to describe smooth potential energy surfaces. To validate this strategy, we performed the excited state calculations at [...] # Excited state calculations using variational quantum eigensolver with spin-restricted ansätze and automatically-adjusted constraints\n\n## Abstract [...] strategy, we performed the excited state calculations at the FC and CI geometries of ethylene and phenol blue at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level of theory, and found that the energy errors were at most 2 kcal mol−1 even on the ibm\\_kawasaki device.", "score": 0.50944775, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/icomputing.0037", "title": "Quantum-Classical Computational Molecular Design of Deuterated ...", "content": "GO TO REFERENCE\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\n17\n\nPeruzzo A, McClean J, Shadbolt P, Yung MH, Zhou XQ, Love PJ, Aspuru-Guzik A, O’Brien JL.
