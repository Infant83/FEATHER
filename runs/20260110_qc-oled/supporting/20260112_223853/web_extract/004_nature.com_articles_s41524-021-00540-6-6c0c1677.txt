## Abstract

A quantum chemistry study of the first singlet (*S*1) and triplet (*T*1) excited states of phenylsulfonyl-carbazole compounds, proposed as useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light emitting diode (OLED) applications, was performed with the quantum Equation-Of-Motion Variational Quantum Eigensolver (qEOM-VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithms on quantum simulators and devices. These quantum simulations were performed with double zeta quality basis sets on an active space comprising the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO) of the TADF molecules. The differences in energy separations between *S*1 and *T*1 (Δ*E**S**T*) predicted by calculations on quantum simulators were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. Differences of 17 and 88 mHa with respect to exact energies were found for excited states by using the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively, to perform simulations on quantum devices without error mitigation. By utilizing state tomography to purify the quantum states and correct energy values, the large errors found for unmitigated results could be improved to differences of, at most, 4 mHa with respect to exact values. Consequently, excellent agreement could be found between values of Δ*E**S**T* predicted by quantum simulations and those found in experiments.

## Introduction

One of the major constraints of modern electronic structure methods used for quantum chemical calculations on classical computing architecture is the difficulty of finding eigenvalues of eigenvectors of the electronic Hamiltonian[1](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR1 "Kühn, M., Zanker, S., Deglmann, P., Marthaler, M. & Weiß, H. Accuracy and resource estimations for quantum chemistry on a near-term quantum computer. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 4764–4780 (2019).").

The advent of quantum computing, which has demonstrated tremendous synergistic advances in both hardware and software capabilities in recent years, may provide invaluable support in the investigation of the electronic structure of molecules and materials, especially with regards to dynamical properties. Algorithms such as the phase estimation algorithm[2](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR2 "Abrams, D. S. & Lloyd, S. Quantum algorithm providing exponential speed increase for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 5162 (1999).") are expected to one day enable practitioners to calculate the Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI or FCI) energy of molecules in polynomial time complexity, in comparison to exponential time currently required for execution on classical computers[3](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR3 "Aspuru-Guzik, A., Dutoi, A. D., Love, P. J. & Head-Gordon, M. Simulated quantum computation of molecular energies. Science 309, 1704–1707 (2005).").

However, quantum computing is still, in many ways, a nascent technology, and quantum devices are currently hamstrung by noisiness and short decoherence times. Thus, instead of the expensive phase estimation algorithm, less-demanding quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm[4](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR4 "Peruzzo, A. et al. A variational eigenvalue solver on a photonic quantum processor. Nat. Commun. 5, 1–7 (2014).") are currently being used to find eigenvalues for approximate Ansätze suitable for constructing relatively short circuits that can be used for quantum chemistry calculations[5](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR5 "Kandala, A. et al. Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets. Nature 549, 242–246 (2017).").

A number of quantum computing use cases for chemistry have been investigated on quantum devices in the recent past. One of the first applications highlighted the construction of ground-state dissociation profiles of hydrogen, lithium hydride, and beryllium hydride via computation using an IBM Q quantum device[5](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR5 "Kandala, A. et al. Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets. Nature 549, 242–246 (2017)."). Researchers have also performed computational studies on the mechanism of the rearrangement of the lithium superoxide dimer using larger devices[6](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR6 "Gao, Q. et al. Computational investigations of the lithium superoxide dimer rearrangement on noisy quantum devices. J. Phys. Chem. A 125, 1827–1836 (2021)."). In the latter case, the orbital determinants of the stationary points were extensively examined to identify a suitable orbital active space for which a reduced number of qubits could be used for computation given the current limitations of these devices. Simulations performed on classical hardware reproduced calculations involving the exact eigensolver known as Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI or FCI) for this process. However, calculations performed on quantum devices using hardware efficient Ansätze were less capable of reproducing exact energies due to noise.

In addition to using the VQE algorithm to compute energies for the dissociation profiles of molecules and the potential energy surfaces for reactions, various algorithms, among them the Quantum Equation-of-Motion VQE (qEOM-VQE)[7](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR7 "Ollitrault, P. J. et al. Quantum equation of motion for computing molecular excitation energies on a noisy quantum processor. Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 043140 (2020).") and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithms[8](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR8 "Higgott, O., Wang, D. & Brierley, S. Variational quantum computation of excited states. Quantum 3, 156 (2019)."), have been developed in order to compute excited states of molecules. In particular, Ollitrault et al. have demonstrated computation of the first three excited states on the dissociation profile for lithium hydride on IBM Quantum hardware[7](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR7 "Ollitrault, P. J. et al. Quantum equation of motion for computing molecular excitation energies on a noisy quantum processor. Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 043140 (2020).").

Here, we take an initial step towards the application of algorithms such as VQE, qEOM-VQE, and VQD to determine ground and excited state energies of industrially relevant molecules. The subject of this study is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters suitable for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications[9](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR9 "Uoyama, H., Goushi, K., Shizu, K., Nomura, H. & Adachi, C. Highly efficient organic light-emitting diodes from delayed fluorescence. Nature 492, 234–238 (2012)."). Once the separation between the first singlet (*S*1) and triplet (*T*1) excited states (Δ*E**S**T*) of such molecules is sufficiently small, non-emissive *T*1 excitons can be thermally excited to an emissive *S*1 state, providing the emission mechanism of TADF emitters. The mechanism enables OLED devices comprised of TADF emitters to potentially perform with 100% internal quantum efficiency, in contrast to devices comprising conventional fluorophores for which the quantum efficiencies are inherently limited to 25%. TADF emitters have been demonstrated as next-generation emission materials for a range of fluorophores and have been utilized in the fabrication of efficient OLEDs[9](#ref-CR9 "Uoyama, H., Goushi, K., Shizu, K., Nomura, H. & Adachi, C.

Y., Yasuda, T., Yang, Y. S., Zhang, Q. & Adachi, C. Luminous butterflies: efficient exciton harvesting by benzophenone derivatives for full-color delayed fluorescence OLEDs. Angew. Chem. Int. 53, 6402–6406 (2014)."),[12](#ref-CR12 "Zhang, Q. et al. Efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Nat. Photonics 8, 326–332 (2014)."),[13](#ref-CR13 "Wong, M. Y. & Zysman-Colman, E. Purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials for organic light-emitting diodes. Adv.

All-organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials for organic light-emitting diodes. Nat. Rev. Mater. 3, 1–20 (2018).").

In order to make TADF emitters commercially viable for OLED displays, high quantum efficiency and stable TADF materials with appropriate emission spectrum must be developed. While density functional theory (DFT) has previously been utilized to help guide the design of TADF emitters by calculating the efficiency and emission spectrum of potential TADF materials[14](#ref-CR14 "Liu, Y., Li, C., Ren, Z., Yan, S. & Bryce, M. R. All-organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials for organic light-emitting diodes. Nat. Rev.

Computational studies of molecular materials for unconventional energy conversion: the challenge of light emission by thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Molecules 25, 1006 (2020)."), the accuracy of DFT methods for such simulations can be quite limited in some cases. For example, DFT methods cannot reliably calculate the high energy singlet and triplet excited states which are required to investigate the mechanism of intersystem crossing in TADF materials. Notably, although quantum algorithms have been developed to simulate excited states on quantum devices, the accuracy of such simulations has not been tested by benchmarking against experimental data.

This manuscript aims to present guidelines on how to reliably reproduce the exact values and predict properties involving excited states for TADF materials by using currently available noisy quantum devices with various quantum algorithms and error mitigation schemes. The singlet-triplet gap, Δ*E**S**T*, which is one of the most important properties for designing high-performance TADF materials, was chosen as a means to test the theoretical calculations. We expect the procedures described in this manuscript to be widely applicable to accurate predictions of singlet-triplet gaps for many types of chemical systems.

A well-established strategy for the computational design of TADF molecules involves identifying emitters in which the HOMO and LUMO orbitals are spatially separated and localized on appropriate moieties. Previous demonstrations have shown that a series of phenylsulfonyl-9H-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules are useful as TADF emitters due to the fact that the Δ*E**S**T* of these molecules can be finely tuned by modifying their electronic properties[20](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#ref-CR20 "Oki, K. O. et al. Composition for forming OLED element, and OLED element. Patent WO/2019/009307 (2019)."). We have elected to perform quantum chemical investigations on the molecules, PSPCz, 2F-PSPCz, 4F-PSPCz (Figs. [1](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#Fig1) and [2](/articles/s41524-021-00540-6#Fig2)), using quantum devices and simulators.

Notably, all three molecules of interest require the use of many more qubits than are currently available on useful quantum hardware or that can be reliably simulated using classical architecture. Thus, qubit reduction techniques must be applied in order to simulate the transition amplitudes of interest to this study. We have reduced the number of spatial orbitals to those that are a
