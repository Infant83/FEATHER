Abstract
--------

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are a revolutionary light-emitting display technology that has been successfully commercialized in mobile phones and televisions[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR1 "Forrest, S. R. The path to ubiquitous and low-cost organic electronic appliances on plastic. Nature 428, 911–918 (2004)."),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR2 "Hong, G. et al. A brief history of OLEDs-emitter development and industry milestones. Adv. Mater. 33, e2005630 (2021)."). The injected charges form both singlet and triplet excitons, and for high efficiency it is important to enable triplets as well as singlets to emit light. At present, materials that harvest triplets by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are a very active field of research as an alternative to phosphorescent emitters that usually use heavy metal atoms[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR3 "Uoyama, H., Goushi, K., Shizu, K., Nomura, H. & Adachi, C. Highly efficient organic light-emitting diodes from delayed fluorescence. Nature 492, 234 (2012)."),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR4 "Wong, M. Y. & Zysman-Colman, E. Purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials for organic light-emitting diodes. Adv. Mater. 29, 1605444 (2017)."). Although excellent progress has been made, in most TADF OLEDs there is a severe decrease of efficiency as the drive current is increased, known as efficiency roll-off. So far, much of the literature suggests that efficiency roll-off should be reduced by minimizing the energy difference between singlet and triplet excited states (Δ _E_ ST) to maximize the rate of conversion of triplets to singlets by means of reverse intersystem crossing (_k_ RISC)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR5 "Hu, Y. X. et al. Efficient selenium-integrated TADF OLEDs with reduced roll-off. Nat. Photonics 16, 803–810 (2022)."),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR6 "Cui, L.-S. et al.

Kinetic prediction of reverse intersystem crossing in organic donor-acceptor molecules. Nat.

Commun. 12, 6640 (2021)."),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR19 "Fan, X.-C. et al.

Photonics 17, 280–285 (2023)."),[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR20 "Zhao, W., He, Z. & Tang, B. Z. Room-temperature phosphorescence from organic aggregates. Nat. Rev. Mater. 5, 869–885 (2020)."). We analyse the efficiency roll-off in a wide range of TADF OLEDs and find that neither of these parameters fully accounts for the reported efficiency roll-off. By considering the dynamic equilibrium between singlets and triplets in TADF materials, we propose a figure of merit for materials design to reduce efficiency roll-off and discuss its correlation with reported data of TADF OLEDs. Our new figure of merit will guide the design and development of TADF materials that can reduce efficiency roll-off. It will help improve the efficiency of TADF OLEDs at realistic display operating conditions and expand the use of TADF materials to applications that require high brightness, such as lighting, augmented reality and lasing.

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are now widely used in displays and are being developed for applications in lighting, sensing and communications[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR1 "Forrest, S. R. The path to ubiquitous and low-cost organic electronic appliances on plastic. Nature 428, 911–918 (2004)."),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR2 "Hong, G. et al. A brief history of OLEDs-emitter development and industry milestones. Adv. Mater. 33, e2005630 (2021)."). They consist of layers of charge transporting and light-emitting organic semiconductors in between two electrodes, at least one of which is transparent. When the injected charges recombine, they form both singlet and triplet excitons. Spin statistics suggest three triplets form for each singlet, a ratio that has been verified for evaporated OLEDs using low molecular weight emitters[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR21 "Segal, M., Baldo, M. A., Holmes, R. J., Forrest, S. R. & Soos, Z. G. Excitonic singlet-triplet ratios in molecular and polymeric organic materials. Phys. Rev. B 68, 075211 (2003)."). In OLEDs using fluorescent materials, only the singlets emit light. Phosphorescent OLED materials were therefore developed to obtain light emission from the triplets as well[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07149-x#ref-CR22 "Baldo, M. A. et al. Highly efficient phosphorescent emission from organic electroluminescent devices. Nature 395, 151–154 (1998)."). These work very well for red and green emission, but there is not yet a blue phosph
