Excited state properties play a pivotal role in various chemical and physical phenomena, such as charge separation and light emission. However, the primary focus of most existing quantum algorithms has been the ground state, as seen in quantum phase estimation and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Although VQE-type methods have been extended to explore excited states, these methods grapple with optimization challenges. In contrast, the quantum Krylov subspace (QKS) method has been introduced to address both ground and excited states, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to quantum phase estimation. However, conventional QKS methodologies depend on a pre-generated subspace through real or imaginary-time evolutions. This subspace is inherently expansive and can be plagued with issues like slow convergence or numerical instabilities, often leading to relatively deep circuits. Our research presents an economic QKS algorithm, which we term the quantum Davidson (QDavidson) algorithm. This innovation hinges on the iterative expansion of the Krylov subspace and the incorporation of a pre-conditioner within the Davidson framework. By using the residues of eigenstates to expand the Krylov subspace, we manage to formulate a compact subspace that aligns closely with the exact solutions. This iterative subspace expansion paves the way for a more rapid convergence in comparison to other QKS techniques, such as the quantum Lanczos. Using quantum simulators, we employ the novel QDavidson algorithm to delve into the excited state properties of various systems, spanning from the Heisenberg spin model to real molecules. Compared to the existing QKS methods, the QDavidson algorithm not only converges swiftly but also demands a significantly shallower circuit. This efficiency establishes the QDavidson method as a pragmatic tool for elucidating both ground and excited state properties on quantum computing platforms.

Structural and dipole (hyper)polarizabilities of the ground and excited singlet states of urea and thiourea: A gas phase CIS(D) theoretical study

* Oct 19, 2009
* Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering
* Carlos Toro + 6 more

A study of the ground and the first five electronic excited singlet states properties of urea and thiourea molecules is reported. Our interest lies on structural features (bond distances and angles), electronic behavior (energy, dipole moment, charges), and the linear (polarizability) and nonlinear (first hyperpolarizability) optical properties of these relevant molecules within each excited state and how different they are from the ground state. Ground state properties were evaluated using ab initio and Density Functional Theory methods at HF, MP2, BLYP, and B3LYP levels on the corresponding optimized geometries, while excited states properties were determined through the CIS and CIS(D) procedures. The standard 6-31+G(d,p) and 6-311++G(3d,3p) basis sets were employed for all these calculations. The results of the ground state properties of urea and thiourea excellently agree with most of the available data in the literature. Moreover, excited state properties appear to be strongly affected within each state, and in general, they are quite different from the ground state values. Particularly, the first hyperpolarizability β represents the most affected property, and some interesting trends are proposed and discussed. Finally, based on our results, we suggest that a study of the excited state properties of both urea and thiourea derivatives can be useful as a guide for designing new nonlinear optical materials.](/article/structural-and-dipole-hyper-polarizabilities-of-the-ground-and-excited-singlet-states-of-urea-and-thiourea-a-gas-phase-cis-d-theoretical-study/1d2cc64d45b43f348ca0a874c81cebbc)[* Research Article

Folded Spectrum VQE: A Quantum Computing Method for the Calculation of Molecular Excited States.

* Mar 16, 2024
* Journal of chemical theory and computation
* Lila Cadi Tazi + 1 more

The recent developments of quantum computing present novel potential pathways for quantum chemistry as the scaling of the computational power of quantum computers could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve electronic structure problems. Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been proposed (e.g., quantum phase estimation), but the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices motivated the development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as an effective method to compute the ground-state energies of small molecules. This study investigates the folded spectrum (FS) method as an extension of the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target energy using the same quantum circuit as for the ground-state calculation. Inspired by the variance-based methods from the quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS method minimizes the energy variance, thus, in principle, requiring a computationally expensive squared Hamiltonian to be applied. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by employing a Pauli grouping procedure to identify sets of commuting Pauli strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant reduction in the computational cost. We applied the FS-VQE method to small molecules (H2, LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical accuracy on ideal quantum simulators. Furthermore, we explore the application of quantum error mitigation techniques, demonstrating improved energy accuracy on noisy simulators compared with simulations without mitigation.](/article/folded-spectrum-vqe-a-quantum-computing-method-for-the-calculation-of-molecular-excited-states/ed323a32c72d3838a95b2885f0212788)[* Research Article

Chemical applications of variational quantum eigenvalue-based quantum algorithms: Perspective and survey

* Jul 1, 2025
* Applied Physics Reviews
* Dominic Alfonso + 3 more

Exploring many-body chemical systems on classical computers often involves solving the Schrödinger equation. However, this approach is frequently limited by the exponential increase in the dimensionality of the Hamiltonian as the number of degrees of freedom increases. In contrast, quantum computing, specifically through the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework, shows promise in overcoming this exponential cost. VQE can utilize the collective properties of quantum states to model the wavefunction in polynomial time. Despite the current limitations of quantum hardware, significant advances have been made in the development of VQE-based algorithms. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging protocols, focusing on their applications in simulating the ground state, excited state, and vibrational properties of chemical systems. By examining notable algorithmic advancements and applications, this review aims to shed light on the challenges and potential of VQE-based algorithms in addressing relevant chemical problems.](/article/chemical-applications-of-variational-quantum-eigenvalue-based-quantum-algorithms-perspective-and-survey/87f1242226cb32d4aee0dc3869fa63bd)[* Research Article

Generalized unitary coupled cluster excitations for multireference molecular states optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver

* Nov 27, 2020
* International Journal of Quantum Chemistry
* Gabriel Greene‐Diniz + 1 more

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, designed to calculate the energy of molecular ground states on near‐term quantum computers, requires specification of symmetries that describe the system, for example, spin state and number of electrons. This opens the possibility of using VQE to obtain excited states as the lowest‐energy solutions of a given set of symmetries. In this paper, the performances of various unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansätze applied to VQE calculations on excited states are investigated using quantum circuits designed to represent single reference and multireference wavefunctions to calculate energy curves with respect to variations in the molecular geometry. These ansätze include standard Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD), as well as modified versions of Unitary Coupled Cluster Generalized Singles and Doubles (UCCGSD) and k‐UpCCGSD, which are engineered to tackle excited states without undesired spin symmetry crossover to lower states during VQE optimization. These studies are carried out on a range of systems, including H2, H3, H4, NH, OH+, CH2, and , covering examples of spin singlet, doublet, and triplet molecular ground states with single and multireference excited states. In most cases, our calculations are in excellent agreement with results from full‐configuration interaction calculations on classical machines, thus showing that the VQE algorithm is capable of calculating the lowest excited state at a certain symmetry, including multireference closed‐ and open‐shell states, by setting appropriate restrictions on the excitations considered in the cluster operator and appropriate constraints in the qubit register encoding the starting mean field state.](/article/generalized-unitary-coupled-cluster-excitations-for-multireference-molecular-states-optimized-by-the-variational-quantum-eigensolver/b374a1aa05d4366c93d588de46acd6c2)[* Research Article

Applications of quantum computing for investigations of electronic transitions in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF emitters

* May 20, 2021
* npj Computational Materials
* Qi Gao + 9 more

A quantum chemistry study of the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states of phenylsulfonyl-carbazole compounds, proposed as useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light emitting diode (OLED) applications, was performed with the quantum Equation-Of-Motion Variational Quantum Eigensolver (qEOM-VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithms on quantum simulators and devices. These quantum simulations were performed with double zeta quality basis sets on an active space comprising the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO) of the TADF molecules. The differences in energy separations between S1 and T1 (ΔEST) predicted by calculations on quantum simulators were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. Differences of 17 and 88 mHa with respect to exact energies were found for excited states by using the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively, to perform simulations on quantum devices without error mitigation. By utilizing state tomography to purify the quantum states and correct energy values, the large errors found for unmitigated results could be improved to differences of, at most, 4 mHa with respect to exact values. Consequently, excellent agreement could be found between values of ΔEST predicted by quantum simulations and those found in experiments.](/article/applications-of-quantum-computing-for-investigations-of-electronic-trans
