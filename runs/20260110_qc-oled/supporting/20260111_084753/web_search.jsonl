An important part of our research focused on determining how two different error mitigation techniques — readout error mitigation and quantum-state tomography — could allow us to accurately compute the excited state energies and transitions of the TADF emitters of interest on today’s quantum computers. [...] Scientists at Mitsubishi Chemical, a member of the IBM Quantum Innovation Center at Keio University in Japan, worked with our team on new approaches to error mitigation and novel quantum algorithms to address these very challenges. In the new arXiv pre-print, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we — along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR — describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. [...] We observed that the most accurate error mitigation procedure involved the use of quantum-state tomography to purify the mixed ground state obtained from the quantum device, and then application of readout error mitigation to excited states. This served to reduce the error from ~7 mHa to ~1 mHa on average. Quantum-state tomography could potentially be applied to other quantum chemistry applications. Going forward, we plan to investigate the scaling of this technique to larger systems.", "score": 0.72977066, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.riverlane.com/blog/quantum-error-correction-our-2025-trends-and-2026-predictions", "title": "Quantum Error Correction: Our 2025 trends and 2026 predictions", "content": "### And finally…\n\nIn 2026, Quantum Error Correction will continue to be the beating heart of the quantum computing industry, marking the true beginning of the sustained engineering and collaborative effort needed to build utility-scale quantum computers.\n\nWe look forward to tackling these complex challenges hand-in-hand with our partners and Riverlane’s dedicated team of QEC experts.\n\nWant to be part of the team tackling quantum's most critical challenge?
