These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters. [...] Here, we take an initial step towards the application of algorithms such as VQE, qEOM-VQE, and VQD to determine ground and excited state energies of industrially relevant molecules. The subject of this study is thermally activated delayed ﬂuorescence (TADF) emitters suitable for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications9. Once the separation between the ﬁrst singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states (ΔEST) of such molecules is sufﬁciently small, non-emissive T1 excitons can be thermally excited to an emissive S1 state, providing the emission mechanism of TADF emitters. [...] Overall, these results demonstrate that quantum computations performed with the qEOM-VQE or VQD algorithms utilizing the Ry Ansatz and the 6-31G(d) basis set on the HOMO-LUMO active space is an adequate method for predicting the ΔEST of the PSPCz molecules of interest.", "score": 0.6139086, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15795", "title": "[PDF] Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic ...", "content": "and 4F-PSPCz.

The maximum error with respect to the exact values for PSPCz, 2F-PSPCz and 4F-PSPCz were 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 mHa from qEOM-VQE calculations and 1.0, 0.8 and 1.3 mHa from VQD calculations, respectively. Thus, excited state energies from both qEOM-VQE and VQD are within chemical accuracy (i.e. 1.6 mHa) of the energies obtained by exact diagonalization. This agreement indicates that calculations derived from qEOM-VQE and VQD with 8192 shots accurately reproduce exact values of the S1 and T1 energies of tested TADF emitters with ∆𝐸!\" ranging from 0.0055 eV (0.2 mHa) to 0.86 eV (31 mHa).

The VQD algorithm is constructed by defining a new Hamiltonian based on the original molecular Hamiltonian and the overlap formed by the wavefunctions of the reference state and the excited states (T1 or S1).  This new Hamiltonian was then used by VQD to compute the energies of the T1 or S1 excited states. VQD calculations were performed using the statevector simulator and on the ibmq_singapore quantum device. For VQD calculations using the statevector simulator, the T1 and S1 states were specified by adding the expectation value of the total spin (〈𝑆#〉) as a penalty term to the cost function  and the ground state obtained from VQE used as both [...] of excited states to an excellent degree, and reliably predict experimental values of ∆𝐸!\" gaps.

While ground states of small molecular systems are typically explored using hybrid variational algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the study of excited states has received much less attention, partly due to the absence of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce the subspace search quantum imaginary time evolution (SSQITE) method, which calculates excited states using [...] 1. INTRODUCTION Computational and theoretical studies of excited states are essential for understanding the photophysics of molecules, particularly in ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy of photochemical reactions.1,2 With the advent of quantum computing, new methodologies promise to signifi-cantly enhance these studies, potentially offering a quantum advantage in chemistry.3,4 Traditional computational methods, despite their powerful capabilities, face limitations in modeling complex excited state phenomena due to the exponential scaling of resources required.

The parties have developed a new scheme to mitigate the error from current noisy quantum computers and succeeded in improving the calculation accuracy. This is the world-first research case of applying quantum computers to excited states calculations of commercial materials. [...] This page uses JavaScript.
