Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, President & CEO Masayuki Waga), IBM Japan, Ltd. (headquartered in Chuo, Tokyo, General Manager Akio Yamaguchi), JSR Corporation (headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, CEO Eric Johnson) and Keio University (headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, President Akira Haseyama) are pleased to announce that a paper describing the research results of “Predicting Optical Properties of OLED Materials on Quantum Computers,” a joint project from IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University,\* has been published in “npj Computational Materials,” a world-renowned Nature Research Journal.   
  
Scientist at Mitsubishi Chemical and IBM initiated a joint research project with collaborators at JSR and Keio University to calculate the excited states of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which are applied to the fabrication of efficient OLEDs. The parties have developed a new scheme to mitigate the error from current noisy quantum computers and succeeded in improving the calculation accuracy. This is the world-first research case of applying quantum computers to excited states calculations of commercial materials.   
  
We expect the proposed error mitigation scheme, together with the improvements of the performance of quantum computers will provide ever more accurate quantum chemistry calculation results for designing OLED emitters with high quantum efficiency in the near term.   
  
We continue research in the area of using quantum computers to accelerate the development of a wide range of new materials.   
  
\*About the IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University   
Opened in May 2018 by Keio University and IBM Japan on the Yagami Campus of the university’s Faculty of Science and Technology, the IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University brings together academia and industry, with Mitsubishi Chemical and JSR as founding members. It is also the first IBM Quantum Hub in Asia leveraging IBM Quantum Systems, the most advanced quantum computers developed by IBM and delivered via the cloud.
