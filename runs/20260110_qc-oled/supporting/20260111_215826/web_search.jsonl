Working principles of OLEDs Due to van der Waals forces, and thus weak electronic coupling between molecules, charge carrier transport in amorphous organic semiconductors is limited by incoherent hopping,26–28 which leads to low mobility.29 Therefore, the charge conduction in OLEDs relies on injected charges from the electrodes and the bulk transport characteristics of the organic layers.

As compared to the σ-bonds, which form the backbone of the molecules, the π-bonding is significantly weaker. As a result, the lowest energetic electron excitation of conjugated organic molecules occurs through π-π type transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO energy levels, which leads to an excited state of the molecule. The energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO is identified as the energy bandgap in organic semiconductors, which is usually between 1.5 and 3 eV, and directly affects optical and charge transport properties.22 The energy gap may be controlled through molecular design, which unlocks various possibilities for the fine-tuning of optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors.
