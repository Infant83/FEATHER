Calculations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms on the statevector simulator accurately reproduced the results from exact diagonalization and provided reliable prediction of ΔEST which are in good agreement with experiments. These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters. [...] Results from qEOM-VQE and VQD calculations on IBM Quantum devices show that noise significantly limits the accuracy of predicted values of excited states. The excited energies were predicted to differ from exact values by as much as 16 and 88 mHa by simulations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms, respectively. A new practical scheme that utilizes quantum state tomography was used to calculate excited states on quantum devices. By using this scheme, excited state energies from both qEOM-VQE and VQD calculations could be computed that are within 4 mHa of energies obtained by exact diagonalization and the corresponding singlet-triplet gaps, ΔEST, are in good agreement with experimental data. We note that our work is the first validated study of excited states using the VQD method [...] An adequate error mitigation approach must be applied to obtain an accurate ground state for use as a reference state to accurately compute excited state energies on a quantum device with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms. Here we have applied the readout error mitigation and quantum state tomography techniques to ground states computed with VQE. This was followed by an examination of energies and the optimized θ parameters of the Ry Ansatz to determine whether results yielded by mitigation approaches are in good agreement with those generated by exact diagonalization.", "score": 0.6077801, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c07429", "title": "Implementation of the Projective Quantum Eigensolver on a ...", "content": "correlation or embedding method.

Calculations performed with the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms on the statevector simulator accurately reproduced the results from exact diagonalization and provided reliable prediction of ΔEST which are in good agreement with experiments. These results show that the qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms are accurate and can be reliably used to develop a fundamental understanding of the relation between structural variation and energies of excited states that could aid in the design of TADF emitters. [...] Here, we take an initial step towards the application of algorithms such as VQE, qEOM-VQE, and VQD to determine ground and excited state energies of industrially relevant molecules. The subject of this study is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters suitable for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications9.\"). Once the separation between the first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states (ΔEST) of such molecules is sufficiently small, non-emissive T1 excitons can be thermally excited to an emissive S1 state, providing the emission mechanism of TADF emitters.

(GMAP in Law)开始了第一期招生，课程侧重国际交易法、国际投资法、国际商事仲裁等“国际商务法”，提供商业管理，商业咨询和争议管理方面的选修课。许多课程重于实践技能，包括模仿国际惯例的角色扮演和互动练习。\n\nKobe LL.M.关键词：国立大学/学费低/重实践/海外实习机会\n\nKanazawa LL.M\n\n金泽大学法学院的起源可以追溯到1881年5月石川县成立师范学院法学院的时代。而金泽大学的历史，可以追溯到1862年的加贺藩种痘所，现在的金泽大学是1949年在合并石川师范大学，金泽医科大学，第四高等学校，金泽工业专门学校等高等学校的基础上，建立起来的一所新体制的综合性大学。\n\n肯定有人吐槽，这么牛我怎么没听说过呢？别急，日本“七帝大”大家一定知道，代表着日本大学的顶尖实力。而金泽大学，就是那“第八所帝国大学”！\n\n金泽大学LL.M.共有四个专业方向可供选择，更加侧重政治和纯法律，涵盖诸如法律概念、宪法，民法，刑法，法学，英美法学和法律史等课程。根据研究方向学生毕业后可取的法学硕士或者政治学硕士学位。\n\nKanazawa LL.M.关键词：国立大学/学费低/重实践/小组教育", "score": 0.034374963, "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 7.83, "request_id": "c4cf23df-b3b7-4fe6-9513-e5df1ed9ee69"}, "timestamp": 1768124006.907517}
