Hi Anzu Partners Community,

This is Henk Both, a Principal at Anzu Partners, where I lead our power and utilities investment focus area. Today I’m going to share more about our portfolio company [XGS Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Exgsenergy%2Ecom%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=1KrC&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), where the team is deploying solid-state geothermal systems.

XGS recently announced another defining milestone in its journey: [Meta has selected XGS Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebusinesswire%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20250612778008%2Fen%2FXGS-Energy-and-Meta-to-Partner-on-150-MW-Advanced-Geothermal-Project%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=8BDJ&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) to develop up to 150 MW of advanced geothermal power to support its data center operations in New Mexico. This represents one of the largest known corporate commitments to advanced geothermal in the U.S., and a major validation of XGS’s innovative next-generation geothermal technology. The announcement generated coverage in top tier publications such as [Reuters](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ereuters%2Ecom%2Fsustainability%2Fboards-policy-regulation%2Fmeta-signs-deal-advanced-geothermal-power-new-mexico-2025-06-12%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=k7Ml&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), [TechCrunch](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch%2Ecom%2F2025%2F06%2F12%2Fmeta-teams-with-xgs-energy-to-build-a-150-mw-geothermal-power-plant%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=e3XX&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), [The Verge](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etheverge%2Ecom%2Fnews%2F686387%2Fmeta-ai-data-center-geothermal-energy-xgs%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=7Uf8&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), [Latitude Media](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elatitudemedia%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Fmeta-bets-on-xgs-energy-in-second-major-geothermal-deal%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=ob6v&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) and more.

Why it matters: XGS’s platform can tap into deep geothermal heat without needing porous rock or underground water reservoirs, expanding the reach of affordable, clean, zero-carbon baseload power to places where traditional geothermal doesn't work. For power-hungry customers like data centers, this means cost-effective, stable, 24/7 clean power without the intermittency challenges of wind and solar.

The partnership with Meta is more than a power deal. It's a signpost for what’s next:

* Scale & Significance: 150 MW could power tens of thousands of homes or a large-scale data center campus, demonstrating that advanced geothermal is ready for grid-scale deployment.
* Speed to Impact: The project will leverage XGS’s rapid-deployment model to deliver power much faster than the 7–10-year timeline for conventional geothermal.
* Strategic Location: While New Mexico has vast geothermal potential, it is not typically considered for large-scale geothermal deployment precisely because its dry climate cannot support the generally high water demands of geothermal power. Many Western US states suffer from the same challenge, which limits interest from other geothermal companies. Fortunately, XGS’s approach requires almost no water, uniquely positioning XGS as a [partner of choice for New Mexico](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebusinesswire%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20250612778008%2Fen%2FXGS-Energy-and-Meta-to-Partner-on-150-MW-Advanced-Geothermal-Project%3Futm_campaign%3DMonthly%2520Newsletter%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-9bH8JbsYuBxsdkLlyQWNrJKxuJyXXKZA2bHAeNjtOEI_ZC2MQGg9di0CDbPCKzRAdfx2z9&urlhash=8BDJ&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) and other Western states.

This milestone builds on rapid progress since our 2022 investment:

* A commercial-scale pilot has surpassed 1,500 operating hours, generating heat with virtually no water consumption.
* Constellation, the nation’s largest nuclear operator, and energy leader Mano Nazar (former President of NextEra's nuclear division) have backed the company as investors, further validating the opportunity.
* A recent bridge round led by Aligned Climate Capital, ClearSky, WovenEarth Ventures, and ClimateIC is fueling scale-up.

We’re proud to support XGS Energy as they move from pilot to full-scale deployment. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from XGS Energy.

Sincerely,

[Henk Both](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henkboth?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention)   , Ph.D., Principal, Anzu Partners
