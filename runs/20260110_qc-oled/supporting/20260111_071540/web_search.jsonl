The thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) phenomenon has attracted increasing attention because it can harvest 100% of the electro-pumped carriers to form singlet bound excited state for fluorescence. It is generally believed that the small energy gap between S1 and T1 (ΔEST) is essential for TADF to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC). However, for a few donor-acceptor (D-A) organic compounds with small ΔEST, the TADF phenomenon is absent, indicating that ΔEST might not be a good molecular descriptor. Here, using our self-developed thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) formalism in combination with quantum chemistry calculations, we revisit the key factors that dominate [...] of forming such bright state is that the electron and hole transfer integrals, te and th, are of the same sign, and should be notably larger than the excitonic coupling (J), that is , te × th > 2J2.

TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent.

Our first scheme approximates the QCC unitary as a sum of symmetrical polynomials of generators up to a given order. The resulting energy expression allows for flexible control of computational complexity via the order parameter. It also guarantees smoothness of trial energies and their derivatives, which is important for gradient-based optimization strategies. The second scheme limits the size of the expansion space in which the QCC unitary is generated. It provides better control of memory requirements but, in general, may lead to the nonsmooth variation of energy estimates upon changes in amplitudes. It can be used, however, to extrapolate energies for a given set of amplitudes toward the exact QCC value. Both schemes allow for a larger number [...] the exact QCC value. Both schemes allow for a larger number of generators to be included in the QCC form compared to the exact formulation. This reduces the number of iterations in the iQCC method and/or leads to higher accuracy. We assess the capabilities of the new schemes to perform QCC amplitudes optimization for a few molecular systems: dinitrogen (N2, 16 qubits), water (H2O, 36 qubits), and tris(2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine) iridium(III), (Ir(F2ppy)3, 80 qubits).
