Through precise doping with heteroatoms, these materials enabled precise tuning of the emission color while maintaining narrow bandwidths and high quantum efficiencies. OLED devices utilizing sulfur-doped BOBS-Z and BSBS-Z as the emissive layers achieved remarkable maximum external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively. Furthermore, by enhancing the light outcoupling efficiency, the bottom-emission OLEDs based on BOBO-Z, BOBS-Z, and BSBS-Z not only exhibited excellent color saturation but also achieved EQEmax values of 16.6%, 33.1%, and 32.2%, respectively (Figure 10f,g). [...] charge-transfer (TSCT) effect, enables the material to exhibit a small ΔEST and a high transition dipole moment. Meanwhile, the through-bond charge-transfer (TBCT) effect, by promoting degenerate molecular orbitals, facilitates multi-channel RISC, enhancing the utilization of triplet excitons. Furthermore, the highly twisted structure of the molecule effectively inhibits intermolecular packing, minimizing solid-state fluorescence quenching and subsequently elevating the PLQY. As illustrated in Figure 9c (molecular structures) and Figure 9d (external quantum efficiency versus current density characteristics), Device A, which is based on T-CNDF-T-tCz, achieved an exceptional EQEmax of up to 21.0%, surpassing Devices B and C, which employed molecules with fewer acceptor segments, namely,", "score": 0.36670366, "raw_content": null, "summary": "| TADF | 4F-ν-DABNA | 35.8 - | (0.13, 0.08) | | | TADF | 4F-m-ν-DABNA | 33.7 - | (0.13, 0.06) | | | TADF | HDT-1 | 41 | 1000 | LT95 = 18 | (0.13, 0.16) | | | TADF | DMAC-DPS | 11.1 - | | Phosphorescent | 9CzFDBFDPO(FIRPIC as emitter) | 23.3 - | (0.16, 0.31) | | | TADF | 9CzFDBFDPO(DMAC-DPS as emitter) | 20.2 | (0.18, 0.22) | | | TADF | T-CNDF-T-t Cz | 21.0 - | (0.19, 0.35) | | | TADF | 23PCX | 25."}, {"url": "https://www.oled-info.com/transforming-materials-science-through-quantum-collaboration", "title": "Transforming Materials Science Through Quantum Collaboration", "content": "OLED-Info logo\nThe OLED Experts\nCoherent - Leading OLED display production with laser solutions\nCoherent - Leading OLED display production with laser solutions\n\n## Main navigation\n\n## Secondary menu\n\n# Transforming Materials Science Through Quantum Collaboration\n\nThis is a guest post by Anastasiia Pusenkova, Quantum Application Lead at Nord Quantique\n\nQuantum computing has seen explosive growth in recent years, offering phenomenal potential across multiple industries such as pharmaceuticals, logistics, energy and cryptography, to name a few.

These advances have propelled theoretical internal quantum efficiency (IQE) towards 100%, with external quantum efficiencies (EQE) exceeding 20% across red, green, and blue devices. However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency, long operational lifetimes, and precise colour purity remains a significant challenge, limiting the full potential of OLED technology. [...] ## A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to OLED Design\n\nThe integration of quantum chemistry calculations with machine learning (ML) strategies represents a crucial advancement in OLED material discovery. Quantum chemistry calculations provide a robust and scalable means of generating molecular descriptors often inaccessible through experimental means, particularly valuable in OLED research where acquiring large, high-quality experimental datasets is hampered by the complexity, cost, and time-consuming nature of molecular synthesis and device fabrication. First-principles methods offer an alternative approach to data acquisition in these circumstances.
