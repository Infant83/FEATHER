Abstract
This review explores the pivotal roles of two advanced nanotechnologies—electrospinning (ES) and fluorescent organic 
nano-dots (FONs) in the development and application of organoluminophores (OLs). As demand intensifies for innovative 
OL-based systems in fields such as biomedical imaging, drug delivery, materials engineering, sensing, and energy, ES and 
FONs present complementary yet distinct technological pathways. Each method offers unique advantages in optimizing 
material properties, compatibility, and optical performance, positioning them at the forefront of OL-based research. ES 
enables precise control over material structure, enhancing performance for scalable industrial applications. FONs deliver 
superior optical properties, particularly for bio-imaging, through environmentally friendly synthesis. This comparative 
analysis critically examines the strengths and limitations of both techniques, including aspects of synthesis complexity, 
material adaptability, functional enhancement, and industrial utilization. Furthermore, recent advancements, ongoing chal­
lenges, and future prospects within this rapidly evolving field are discussed, providing a comprehensive perspective on 
the potential of these luminescent technologies to drive next-generation OL applications.

1  Introduction
Electrospinning method is currently at the forefront of 
research [1–4] and industrialization of fiber-based polymer 
materials due to its attractive properties such as the huge 
length-to-diameter ratio, the ability to produce smooth 
nanofibers, and the ease of manipulating the composition 
and properties of the fibers being formed.
Compared with other methods of manufacturing 
nanoscale fibers (e.g. drawing, coating, printing [5]) ES is a 
fairly automated, versatile, and affordable method, that has 
been constantly developing. Although the concept of elec­
trospinning was developed back in the sixteenth century, its 
practical application has become widespread only in the last 
two decades. This innovative method has found wide appli­
cation in various fields, including tissue engineering [6], 
sensor technology [7], drug delivery systems [8], fluores­
cent semiconductor development [9], biotechnology [10], 
filtration processes [11] and many other fields (Fig. 1 left). 
Depending on the type of their laying, electrospun fibers can 
be used to form membranes that will be characterized by 
good flexibility and mechanical strength, porosity, as well as 
hydrophobic and catalytic properties [12]. The introduction 
of various additives into polymer matrices helps to increase 
thermostability, fiber formation capacity, and luminescence 
capability. The inclusion of inorganic compounds (e.g., 
metal ions [13]), organic dyes (e.g., fluorescent dyes [14]) 
or π-conjugated polymers [15] can purposefully change both 
physical and chemical properties. OL’s, being semiconduc­
tors, serve as promising additives for research involving 
electrospun fibers, showing considerable potential and wide 
application in various fields [16–18].

This review focuses on electrospinning as the primary 
technique for creating polymer nanofibers with unique char­
acteristics. Compared to other methods, electrospinning is 
highly adaptable, cost-efficient, and widely adopted, with 
the added benefit of being automated. Through the addition 
of various modifiers, properties of electrospun fibers can 
be tailored, making them particularly suitable for applica­
tions involving organoluminophores (OLs) across scien­
tific and industrial domains. In this article, we explore the 
use of electrospinning specifically for incorporating OLs 
into fibrous structures. OLs offer high luminescence and a 
broad spectral range, positioning them as valuable compo­
nents in functional light-emitting materials. Electrospinning 
allows for the uniform embedding of organic luminescent 
molecules in nanofibers, enhancing brightness stability. 
Furthermore, the flexibility of this method in shaping mate­
rial morphology and tuning optical properties broadens the 
potential applications of OLs in fields such as sensor devel­
opment, biomedical imaging, and flexible electronics.
Nanoparticles (NPs) are valuable tools in biochemistry, 
pharmacy, and biomedical sciences. Their small size allows 
unique characteristics to emerge, vastly different from bulk 
materials. Like electrospun fibers, characterized by a high 
surface-to-volume ratio and unique chemical properties, 
NPs find applications in biomedical fields like drug deliv­
ery, imaging, and diagnostics [19–21]. The development of 
organic dye nanoparticles makes a major breakthrough in 
fluorescence research. Organic dyes exhibit fluorescence 
through two mechanisms: resonant transitions and charge-
transfer (CT) transitions. Resonant dyes, such as fluores­
ceins and rhodamines, are characterized by well-defined, 
narrow absorption and emission spectra with small Stokes 
shifts. On the other hand, solvent polarity has a significant 
impact on the bigger Stokes shifts and wider, structure­
less bands displayed by CT dyes such as coumarins. Early 
attempts to produce organic dye nanoparticles encoun­
tered difficulties because of their limited thermal stability 
and mechanical strength relative to inorganic materials. A 
breakthrough came in the 1990s when Nakanishi and col­
laborators introduced the “reprecipitation method,” facili­
tating the systematic synthesis of organic dye nanoparticles. 
This innovation led to the discovery of size-dependent pho­
tophysical properties, including fluorescence, in various 
organic systems. Subsequent research has expanded these 
methodologies, introducing a wide array of organic dyes and 
fabrication strategies, thereby enhancing the versatility and 
application potential of fluorescent organic nanoparticles 
[22–24]. Nowadays, there’s increasing interest in enhanc­
ing nanoparticles for bioimaging, biosensing, optics, and 
more[25]. This review focuses on FONs, i.e., fluorescent 
organic nanoparticles, which are versatile nanostructures 
emitting light across spectra, offering diverse applications 
in biology and medicine, with potential for combined diag­
nostics and therapy (Fig. 1 right) [25, 26].
FONs propose several significant advantages over other 
materials. One of many is their better stability, biocompat­
ibility and better light scattering effect. Additionally, com­
pared to nanoparticles made from metals and inorganic 
compounds, organic nanoparticles are cheaper, can be pre­
pared in a simple way and have a high possibility of modifi­
cation by inserting other functional groups [25, 27].
Luminescent nanoparticles from conjugated polymers 
address processing challenges, especially in multilayer 
devices [28] Synthesizing them via dispersed system polym­
erization offers advantages like access to stable materials 
for tasks such as cell imaging and creating nanocomposites. 
These nanoparticles are recognized for their potential in cell 
imaging. Despite their wide use in organic light-emitting 
diodes (OLEDs) and color conversion layers (CCLs), fluo­
rescent and phosphorescent compounds are not extensively 
researched, highlighting the importance of further analysis 
[26].
In our review, we aim to thoroughly examine the 
strengths and weaknesses of both methods concerning their 
effectiveness in organic fluorophore technology. By ana­
lyzing aspects such as manufacturing complexity, compat­
ibility with semiconductors and other materials, as well as 
the enhancement of optical properties, we can determine 
their suitability for specific applications. Additionally, we 
will explore the latest trends, achievements, challenges, and 
prospects in this area, providing insights into the evolving 
industry of organic semiconductor technologies.
1.1  Background
Electrospinning, originally termed electrostatic spinning, 
has its conceptual roots in the sixteenth century, when the 
Royal College of Physicians observed the formation of 
a cone and ejection of droplets from a water drop near a 
charged piece of amber—a precursor to the modern Taylor 
cone. It wasn’t until the early twentieth century that electros­
pinning was formally recognized for its potential to produce 
fibers, leading to its first patent [29]. Since then, the technol­
ogy has evolved significantly, with rapid advancements over 
the past few decades transforming it into a highly versatile 
method for fabricating nanofibers with intricate structures. 
These developments have not only refined the technique 
but also expanded its applications, fostering innovations in 
fields ranging from materials science to biomedicine [30].
Electrospinning is a technique for micro- and nano-
scale fiber fabrication from polymer solutions. Using an 
appropriate voltage applied to the steel needle and adjust­
ing the process parameters, morphologically different types 
of fibers can be produced. In modern times, a vast array of

peptide-based nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, quantum 
dots, polymer-based nanoparticles, inorganic vectors, lipid-
based nanoparticles, hybrid NPs, and metal nanoparticles. 
Nanoparticles are a new and growing area of research fields 
like delivering medicine, studying tiny fluids, making sen­
sors, analyzing tiny samples, and engineering tissues for 
treating diseases better [32–35]. Fluorescent organic nano-
dots are one branch of nanoparticle development.
Despite the existence of many methods of producing 
nanoparticles, the most successful and simple approaches 
are solvent evaporation, emulsification or nanoprecipita­
tion [26]. There are various approaches to acquiring FONs, 
depending on the preferred structure and intended use. 
Numerous methods exist for obtaining nanoparticles, but 
not many consist of fluorophores.
FONs can be created through the precipitation of the fluo­
rophore solution upon mixing with water. The incorporation 
of a surfactant enables micelles to encapsulate the fluoro­
phore particles during precipitation, facilitated by the inter­
action between the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant and 
the nonpolar fluorophore molecules (Fig. 2). Surfactant is 
intended to minimize the surface energy of small particles. 
In the absence of surfactant, surface energy is minimized 
during the formation of large fluorophore particles. There 
are different methods of creating FONs, some are very sim­
ple, while others are more demanding.
Emulsions are solutions of immiscible liquids, catego­
rized by their size into micro-emulsions (10– 100 nm), mini-
emulsions (100 nm– 1 µm), and macro-emulsions (> 1 µm). 
Nano-emulsions fall between micro- and mini-emulsions 
and can be created using low or high energy methods. Low 
energy emulsification relies on spontaneous processes, 
electrospinning machine variations has been developed, 
ranging from needleless to ultrasound-enhanced designs. 
Nevertheless, all these systems operate on a similar funda­
mental principle. Figure 2 (left) illustrates a basic electros­
pinning setup, consisting of a syringe pump (A) that ensures 
a constant flow of solution through a steel needle (B). High 
voltage (C) generates electrostatic forces that pull the solu­
tion into a Taylor cone, ejecting fine fibers that deposit on a 
collector (D). The formation of fibers depends on solution’s 
parameters such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface ten­
sion. The needle size influences fiber diameter, while flow 
rate must be carefully regulated to avoid droplet formation 
or jet interruption. The collector type also plays a critical 
role: a flat, stationary collector produces randomly oriented 
fibers, while rotating or patterned collectors can align or 
structure the fibers. Optimizing these factors is crucial, as 
each adjustment impacts the morphology, diameter, and uni­
formity of the electrospun fibers.
The first use of nanoparticles dates to the fourth century 
AD. A cup found from that time, made of special glass con­
taining gold and silver nanoparticles with the addition of 
copper, emitted a different glow at a certain angle [31].
The use of nanoparticles in scientific research has pro­
gressed significantly over the years, with studies dem­
onstrating their wide-ranging applications and potential 
benefits. The connection between nanoparticles and biomed­
icine was established in the late 1970s, and by 2005, nearly 
thirty papers referred to this topic. Within a decade, Web of 
Science published over 1000 articles on nanomedicine in 
2015, with a majority focusing on nanoparticles (NPs) for 
biomedical applications. Advanced forms of nanoparticles 
(NPs) include nanocarriers such as dendrimers, liposomes,

advancements in the field of nanotechnology and its envi­
ronmental applications.
In the study conducted in 2023 [37], the integration of 
a copper-based complex into a poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) matrix demonstrates the potential of electrospin­
ning to create hybrid organic–inorganic nanofibers with 
tailored photoluminescent properties. A tetrakis((μ3-N-
(3,5-dichlorosalicyclideneamino)ethanolato)-Cu(II)) 
was 
synthesized and incorporated into PMMA via electrospin­
ning to form Cu@PMMA nanofibers with diameters rang­
ing from 148 to 307  nm. Under UV excitation, both the 
complex and nanofibers exhibited blue emission. The pho­
toluminescence (PL) intensity of the nanofibers increased 
with Cu2⁺ concentration, peaking at 15 wt.% before declin­
ing due to concentration quenching. Temperature-depen­
dent PL measurements (10–300 K) revealed a decrease in 
emission intensity due to thermal quenching. These nanofi­
bers, with high chromaticity values, show promise for blue 
solid-state lighting applications. The ability to fine-tune the 
composition and structural properties of such hybrid nano­
fibers demonstrates electrospinning’s potential in develop­
ing advanced materials for optical and solid-state lighting 
technologies.
In a 2021 study, P.S. Umabharathi and S. Karpagam 
demonstrated the versatility of electrospinning method by 
successfully integrating cadmium sulfide (CdS) as an inor­
ganic component with conjugated polymers and carbazole-
based compounds as organic luminophores (Scheme 1). The 
researchers found that this combination facilitated good 
dispersion and compatibility within the electrospinning 
process, leading to enhanced photoluminescent properties 
and thermal stability. Spectroscopic analyses revealed a red 
while high energy emulsification involves vigorous mixing 
to disperse one substance into microscopic droplets within 
another. These methods are crucial in industries like food, 
pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics for achieving precise prod­
uct quality and consistency. Generating nanoparticles from 
emulsions involves eliminating solvents through methods 
like evaporation, salting-out, or diffusion. Overall, these 
methods offer cost-effective ways to obtain nanoparticles 
with significant advantages [36].
Thus, based on the methods of producing electrospun 
fibers and fluorescent nanoparticles, both approaches are 
relatively straightforward to implement, making them 
advantageous in terms of manufacturability. Their respec­
tive strengths and limitations are further discussed below, 
supported by the latest scientific studies.
2  Advantages and Disadvantages of Both 
Methods
2.1  Versatility in Used Materials
The flexibility in material selection for the disposal of OLs 
offers researchers a broader spectrum of options for opti­
mizing the efficiency of nanotechnology applications. This 
adaptability facilitates the development of innovative strate­
gies for recycling and waste management, allowing for the 
effective degradation and recovery of valuable components. 
By integrating various organic and inorganic materials, sci­
entists can enhance sustainability and effectiveness in utiliz­
ing organic luminescent materials, which ultimately propels

inorganic materials to create highly functional hybrid sen­
sors. Researchers developed a novel chemical warfare agent 
sensor by immobilizing polyquinoxaline based conjugated 
polymer dots (CPdots) (Scheme 2) on poly(vinyl alcohol) 
(PVA)-silica electrospun nanofibers, resulting in a dots-on-
fibers (DoF) structure. The electrospinning process enabled 
stable electrostatic interactions between the amine-func­
tionalized PVA-silica fibers and the CPdots, preserving the 
high emissive properties essential for sensitive detection. 
This DoF nanostructure exemplifies how electrospinning 
can be adapted to create rapid, portable sensors, with poten­
tial for other applications by simply altering the probe dots. 
Additionally, this research further confirms the capability of 
electrospinning to utilize macrocyclic compounds, expand­
ing the scope of materials that can be integrated into hybrid 
sensor systems.
Similarly, as electrospinning method fluorescent organic 
nano-dots demonstrate remarkable versatility by effectively 
shift in emission, indicating effective interaction between 
the organic and inorganic components. The electrospin­
ning method effectively harnesses the unique properties 
of both organic luminophores and inorganic CdS, as also 
compatibility with conjugated polymers and macromolecu­
lar organic molecules, enabling advanced applications in 
optoelectronics.
In another study of the same year [39], researchers 
investigated the creation of luminescent electrospun fibers 
by incorporating rhodamine-doped metal–organic frame­
works (MOFs) within a polymer matrix (Fig.  3). MOFs 
are a promising class of crystalline materials with tunable 
porosity, high surface area, chemical stability, and diverse 
functional groups, making them ideal for applications in 
gas separation, catalysis, drug delivery, and advanced tech­
nologies [40]. The results of the study demonstrated that 
the electrospun rhodamine@MOF/polymer fibers achieved 
an impressive quantum yield, underscoring the versatility 
of the electrospinning method in integrating both organic 
luminescent dyes and inorganic frameworks, as also the 
MOFs themselves as separate group of materials, to enhance 
luminescent properties. This synergy not only improves 
luminescence but also ensures thermal stability, allowing 
the fibers to retain their luminescent characteristics even 
at elevated temperatures, making them suitable for a wide 
range of applications.
The next study [41] highlights the versatility of elec­
trospinning method in integrating both organic and

cysteine highlights the adaptability of these hybrid AIE dots 
in dynamic sensing applications, establishing their potential 
for advanced environmental and biochemical monitoring. 
This study further demonstrates that FONs are capable of 
integrating inorganic and organic substances not only within 
the nanoparticles but also on their surface, significantly 
expanding the research landscape, particularly in the field 
of sensors.
According to those publications, there are no inherent 
material limitations when selecting components for both 
electrospinning and FONs methods. Studies demonstrate 
that each technique can effectively conjugate with a wide 
range of compounds, including large macrocyclic struc­
tures, polymers, and inorganic materials. This versatility 
underscores potential for diverse applications across vari­
ous scientific and industrial fields either for ES or for FONs 
methods.
2.2  Luminescent Properties and Emission Dynamics 
Enhancement
In 2009, a group of scientists [44] carried out a study on 
light-emitting electrospun nanofibers derived from mixtures 
of three components: poly(9,9-dioctylfluoreny-2,7-diyl) 
(PFO), 
poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenyl­
enevinylene] (MEH-PPV), and poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) (Scheme 3). The morphology of the resulting 
matrixes was analyzed via field emission scanning electron 
incorporating both organic luminophores and inorganic ele­
ments to enhance functionality. In Khan et al.’s study [42], 
boron-containing organic luminophores (Fig. 4) were syn­
thesized into FONs that acted as efficient color conversion 
layers (CCLs) for optoelectronic applications, converting 
short-wavelength light into specific wavelengths with pre­
cision. By introducing ionic and non-ionic surfactants, the 
researchers achieved high stability and water-processability 
in FONs, addressing challenges typically faced with inor­
ganic quantum dots, such as instability and toxicity. This 
hybrid approach leverages organic and inorganic compo­
nents for environmentally friendly, high-performance CCLs 
with superior color conversion efficiency and long-term sta­
bility, highlighting the adaptability of FONs across various 
optoelectronic applications.
Poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) based FONs 
with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) gen (9,10-distyry­
lanthracene) demonstrate same remarkable versatility by 
integrating organic and inorganic elements to develop highly 
sensitive and selective sensors (Fig. 5). In Jiang et al.’s study 
[43], the AIE-active organic dots were functionalized with 
inorganic components on their surface, creating an efficient 
“on–off-on” chemosensor for detecting metal ions such as 
copper (Cu2⁺) and iron (Fe3⁺). The interaction between the 
surface-bound inorganic materials and the organic AIEgen 
significantly enhanced the fluorescence response, allowing 
for the detection of metal ions with remarkable sensitivity.

emission colors compared to spin-coated films. This high­
lights the significant impact of the electrospinning method 
in fabricating advanced light sources and sensor materials.
In another study [45], the relationship between photolu­
minescence polarization and electrospinning was investi­
gated. By utilizing conjugated MEH-PPV and polyethylene 
oxide (PEO) polymers in a 1:2 ratio, aligned anisotropic 
fibers were successfully produced. The polarized emission 
was quantified using a fluorescent spectrometer equipped 
with excitation and emission polarizers. The polarization 
coefficient of photoluminescence (PL), which compares the 
intensity of light emitted parallel and perpendicular to the 
alignment direction, was found to be 13.3 for unstretched 
samples, surpassing recent studies. This indicates a strong 
directional preference in the emission of light. Upon stretch­
ing, this coefficient increased to 25, indicating the effec­
tiveness of the two-step process involving alignment and 
stretching in fine-tuning polarization. The study demon­
strated that electrospinning could yield highly polarized PL 
from aligned MEH-PPV/PEO nanofibers, with polarization 
microscope (FE-SEM) and fluorescence microscopy. Photo­
luminescent analysis revealed that the emission colors of the 
PFO/MEH-PPV/PMMA mixture shifted from blue to white, 
yellowish-green, greenish-yellow, orange to yellow with an 
increase in MEH-PPV content. Conversely, films obtained 
by another method, mainly by spin-coating, emitted colors 
ranging from blue to orange, pink–red, red and deep-red. 
This difference likely stems from solubility parameters, as 
two of the three components are blending with each other 
and trapped in the PMMA matrix, enabling energy transfer 
between PFO and MEH-PPV. The polymer domains in elec­
trospun fibers were significantly smaller than in spin-coated 
films, resulting in different emission colors and increased 
luminescence efficiency. Additionally, fibers made via elec­
trospinning exhibited higher photoluminescence efficiency 
compared to the spin-coated ones. This study illustrates the 
versatility of electrospinning in producing light-emitting 
nanofibers with varied colors by optimizing semiconduc­
tor polymer compositions. The electrospun fibers exhibited 
enhanced luminescence efficiency and a broader range of

generated trapping potentials weaker than thermal energy. 
By comparing the local electric field strength and variations 
in QD concentration, the researchers computed the polariz­
ability, which was found to agree with estimates based on 
the hydrodynamic diameter obtained using light scattering. 
Strikingly, the polarizability of the nanoparticles increased 
30-fold in low salt conditions compared to high salt condi­
tions, attributed to the increased thickness of the Debye layer 
relative to the particle radius. This study not only provided 
evidence that corroborated theoretical work studying direct 
solutions to the Poisson − Nernst − Planck equations but also 
offered an explanation for the previously observed conduc­
tivity dependence of biomolecule polarizability. Given the 
significance of nanoparticle polarizability for the electri­
cally directed assembly of particles and their interactions 
with other materials in complex environments, the research­
ers anticipated that these results would be highly relevant to 
ongoing efforts in materials by design and nanomedicine.
In 2017 a group of researchers worked on develop­
ing conjugated polymer nanoparticles constructed with 
imidazole units (Fig. 7) [47]. The primary issue lies in the 
non-degradability of conjugated polymer nanoparticles 
(CPNPs), primarily stemming from their inert and carbon-
based π-conjugated structure. This lack of degradability 
within conjugated polymer particle systems poses a signifi­
cant obstacle to their safe use in vivo. The compounds they 
created addressed the issue by combining both intense fluo­
rescence and biodegradability. CPNPs display hydrophobic 
characteristics and demonstrate minimal cytotoxicity. With 
their π-conjugated electron system, they emit strong fluo­
rescence, offering tunable emission colors across the vis­
ible spectrum. CPNPs also serve as effective photoacoustic 
adjustability achieved through mechanical stretching. This 
highlights the efficacy of electrospinning in enhancing pho­
toluminescent polarization, potentially benefiting optoelec­
tronic devices.
In 2019, researchers developed a novel method to quan­
tify the polarizability of photoluminescent nanoparticles 
in water (Fig. 6), presenting experimental observations of 
the extraordinary polarizability exhibited by nanoparticles 
of commensurate size with the Debye screening length, 
which confirmed previously reported theory [46]. The 
Debye length measures how electric fields are screened in a 
medium, particularly in electrolyte solutions, and it quanti­
fies the distance over which significant charge separation 
can occur due to the presence of mobile charge carriers like 
ions. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) served as ideal 
model nanoparticles to demonstrate this assay due to their 
tunable size and bright photoluminescence. The assay was 
based on microfluidic chambers with microelectrodes that

of dichloromethane vapor. This fluorescence switching 
characteristic introduces a fresh approach to nanoscale fluo­
rescence switches capable of detecting organic vapors. Pro­
duced nanoparticles demonstrate significantly intensified 
light emission and on/off switching capabilities, enabling 
the detection of organic vapors. The increased fluorescence 
emission in CN-MBE nanoparticles is attributed to a com­
bination of molecular flattening (planarization) and J-aggre­
gation, a process where molecules stack closely together 
in an orderly manner, limiting unwanted energy loss and 
enhancing light emission.
In contrast to traditional organic dyes, fluorescent probes 
derived from nanoparticles boast increased brightness and 
improved photostability, proving their efficacy across vari­
ous biological applications [49].
Xiaofeng Luo and others conducted a study focused on 
the synthesis of nanoparticles utilizing fluorescent dyes 
(DBQ-3PXZ) exhibiting both thermal activation delayed 
fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation-induced emission 
(AIE) properties [50]. To enhance the photostability of the 
fluorescent nanoparticles, two strategies were employed 
during their construction to get rid of the photobleaching 
of aggregation induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF) dyes. 
Nanoparticles were synthesized by physically incorporating 
an AIDF dye into an amphiphilic polymer via a reprecipita­
tion technique. The first approach focused on isolating the 
AIDF dye component from molecular oxygen by optimiz­
ing the oxygen permeability of the amphiphilic polymer. 
The second approach involved the incorporation of low-
molecular-weight antifade agents specifically designed to 
counteract the oxygen-mediated photodegradation of the 
AIDF dye. Drawing from the afore mentioned method­
ologies, a significant reduction in photobleaching of the 
desired fluorescent nanoparticles, while maintaining opti­
mal brightness, was ultimately noted. The unique qualities 
of the resultant fluorescent nanoparticles, distinguished by 
their enhanced brightness, exceptional photostability, and 
extended excited-state lifespan, unmistakably designate this 
probe as an optimal candidate for biological fluorescence 
imaging. The initial fluorescence results obtained from liv­
ing cells undeniably validated the feasibility of utilizing the 
feature-rich fluorescent nanoparticles for imaging purposes, 
showcasing an outstanding signal-to-noise ratio within the 
intracellular physiological environment.
The reviewed studies highlight significant advancements 
in enhancing luminescent properties and emission dynamics 
through electrospinning and fluorescent organic nanoparti­
cles methods of nanomaterials production. By optimizing 
polymer compositions, researchers have achieved a wide 
range of emission colors and improved luminescence effi­
ciency. Aligned nanofibers also exhibit notable photolumi­
nescence polarization, enhancing their application potential 
contrast agents and are valuable in image-guided photody­
namic and photothermal therapy. Their inherent semicon­
ducting properties ensure exceptionally stable fluorescence, 
enabling prolonged detection periods. Furthermore, CPNPs 
can be customized with surface functionalization using bio­
logical recognition molecules like peptides, antibodies, and 
others. In this study, researchers have developed the ability 
to create conjugated polymer particles based on imidazole 
compounds that are biodegradable. Upon exposure to stim­
ulated macrophages, the concentration of reactive oxygen 
species is adequate to degrade these particles. Compared 
to inorganic materials that undergo fluorescent degrada­
tion, conjugated polymer particles provide greater optical 
enhancement due to the dense packing of the luminophore. 
This allows for the potential use of conjugated polymer par­
ticles in biological and medical fields, such as imaging, drug 
delivery, and others. Tailored nanoparticles are utilized to 
precisely target specific biomolecular patterns on cell mem­
branes, particularly in pathological conditions such as can­
cerous tumors.
In 2002, [48] researchers conducted a study based on cre­
ating a new class of organic nanoparticles made of 1-cyano-
trans-1,2-bis-(4′-methylbiphenyl)-ethylene 
(CN-MBE) 
(Scheme 4) with a diameter ranging from 30 to 40 nm. They 
were prepared by a simple reprecipitation method and exhib­
ited strongly enhanced fluorescence emission. Researchers 
noticed that the CN-MBE nanoparticle emits very strong 
fluorescence, even though CN-MBE itself doesn’t fluoresce 
much in a weak solution. CN-MBE exhibited a striking fluo­
rescence intensity shift, transitioning from a non-fluorescent 
state as isolated single molecules in THF to a highly fluores­
cent suspension of nanoparticles in THF/water. This intensi­
fied emission from nanoparticles is clearly illustrated by the 
variations in the relative quantum yield (Φf) of CN-MBE 
(2 × 10–5 mol L−1) across different proportions of THF/water 
mixtures. Isolated CN-MBE, up to 50% volume fractions of 
water addition, displayed virtually negligible fluorescence 
(Φf ≈ 0.001). At 80% volume fractions of water addition, 
the Φf value of the CN-MBE nanoparticle suspension was 
nearly 700 times greater compared to that of the CN-MBE 
solution in THF. The utilization of nanoparticles for on/
off fluorescence switches was examined by comparing the 
fluorescent intensity in solution and nanoparticles. When 
illuminated with 365 nm UV light at room temperature, CN-
MBE nanoparticles on the TLC plate exhibit vibrant blue 
fluorescence, which reversibly switches off in the presence

forth during the ES process, height-aligned nanofibers were 
collected between the metal legs. Luminescent polariza­
tion spectroscopy was employed to assess the anisotropy 
of emission from the resulting aligned conjugated polymer 
fibers. The findings revealed that the photoluminescence of 
aligned nanofibers exhibited strong anisotropy, with more 
intense emission along the axis of the nanofibers, while the 
PL of random nanofibers showed weak emission anisot­
ropy. Moreover, the emission of random nanofibers shifted 
towards the blue spectrum with a decrease in the mass ratio 
of MEH-PPV/PEO, likely attributed to reduced aggregation 
of MEH-PPV macromolecular chains in the nanofibers. The 
intrinsically ordered and polycrystalline nature of P3HT in 
the solid state contributed to a higher luminescence anisot­
ropy of aligned nanofibers compared to MEH-PPV/PEO. 
The results of the study suggest that electrospun conjugated 
polymer nanofibers possess macromolecular chains that 
are preferentially oriented along the axis of the nanofiber. 
Thus, electrospinning displayed as a promising method for 
precisely controlling the orientation of macromolecular 
chains within nanofibers, thereby influencing their optical 
properties.
Unlike electrospinning, the use of fluorescent nanopar­
ticles does not enable the control of macromolecular chain 
orientation within the nanoparticles themselves, which pres­
ents a limitation of this method. Current literature primarily 
discusses the manipulation of nanoparticle orientation via 
electrospinning [52] or investigating the alteration of opti­
cal properties within nanoparticle clusters [53]. This lack 
of control over macromolecular orientation within fluores­
cent nano-dots underscores a disadvantage relative to the 
capabilities offered by electrospinning for achieving desired 
alignment and properties in luminescent materials.
in optoelectronic devices. Additionally, biodegradable con­
jugated polymer nanoparticles combine strong fluorescence 
with biocompatibility, enabling innovative uses in medical 
imaging and targeted drug delivery. Overall, these advance­
ments underscore the versatility of electrospinning and 
FONs, paving the way for future applications in advanced 
light sources and sensors.
2.3  Orientation Control of Macromolecular Chains
Orientation control of macromolecular chains in organo­
luminophores is crucial for optimizing their performance 
in optoelectronic applications. Proper alignment enhances 
photophysical properties such as absorption, emission, 
and quantum yield, while enabling polarized emission that 
improves display contrast. Additionally, controlled orienta­
tion facilitates exciton and charge carrier mobility, result­
ing in increased efficiency in devices. It also allows for 
the tuning of emission wavelengths and intensities, which 
is important for specific applications. Furthermore, well-
aligned structures enhance stability and durability, ensuring 
long-term performance, and minimize unfavorable intermo­
lecular interactions that can quench luminescence. Over­
all, effective orientation control is vital for maximizing the 
efficiency, stability, and tunability of organoluminophores, 
making them more suitable for advanced optoelectronic 
devices.
In a study conducted in 2011 [51] the effect of ES on 
photoluminescence and anisotropy was investigated using 
aligned nanofibers. Uniaxially aligned nanofibers were 
produced from two pairs of conjugated polymers via elec­
trospinning: MEH-PPV/PEO and poly(3-hexylthiophene) 
(P3HT)/PEO (Scheme 5). The ratio of conjugated polymer 
to PEO by weight was 1:4, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40. A U-shaped 
metal device was prepared to ensure well-aligned electros­
pun nanofibers. By manually moving the device back and

In 2015, Yang-Hsiang Chan et al. [49] outlined a trend 
in the advancement of semiconducting polymer dots, not 
only for biological imaging but also for sensing purposes. 
In a study conducted in 2009 [55] researchers described a 
new nanoparticle structure for oxygen sensing comprises 
p-conjugated polymer molecules doped with an oxygen-
sensitive phosphorescent dye. When stimulated by light, 
the polymer effectively channels energy to the phospho­
rescent dye, yielding vivid phosphorescence that exhibits 
exceptional sensitivity to the levels of dissolved oxygen. 
Researchers proved the energy-transfer-mediated phospho­
rescence observed in metalloporphyrin-doped polyfluorene 
nanoparticles, along with its utilization in biological oxygen 
sensing. CPNPs demonstrate exceptional light-absorbing 
capabilities when contrasted with conventional nanoparti­
cles containing dye, silica, or polymer, leading to absorption 
cross-sections surpassing 10–12 cm2 (for particles approxi­
mately 25 nm in diameter). Fluorescence spectroscopy and 
time-resolved fluorescence measurements reveal efficient 
energy transfer from the host polymer to the metalloporphy­
rin acceptors. This results in a radiant phosphorescence that 
demonstrates high sensitivity to the concentration of molec­
ular oxygen. The small size, exceptional brightness under 
both conventional and two-photon excitation, and the abil­
ity to emit ratiometrically of the nanoparticle sensor, along 
with the successful demonstration of single-particle sens­
ing and cellular uptake, underscore the potential of doped 
CPNPs for precise mapping of local molecular oxygen lev­
els in living cells and tissues. The distinctive characteristics 
of the nanoparticle sensors such as their diminutive dimen­
sions, remarkable luminosity, and radiometric emission 
2.4  Adjustable Energy Transfer Capabilities
In their study [54], researchers selected coaxial electrospin­
ning technology to produce a white-light-emitting porous 
fibrous membrane. This approach allowed for the spatial 
separation of blue energy donor (1,8-naphthalic anhydride) 
and orange energy acceptor (perylene mono-anhydride) flu­
orescent dyes (Scheme 6) within the membrane, effectively 
preventing energy transfer and resulting in uniform white 
light emission. They chose polylactide (PLA) as the matrix 
material due to its pore-forming capabilities, ensuring mini­
mal interference with the fluorescent dyes and maximizing 
emission efficiency. Through adjustment of the dye concen­
tration ratio, the researchers achieved efficient membrane 
preparation. The morphology of the fibrous membrane emit­
ting white light was examined using SEM and TEM. PL 
spectra and lifetime measurements of the membrane were 
obtained using a fluorescent spectrophotometer, alongside 
the absorption spectra of fluorescent molecules captured 
using a fluorescence spectrometer. By introducing a porous 
surface structure using PLA, the interaction between the 
polymer matrix and the dye molecules was significantly 
reduced. The resulting membrane exhibited both flexibility 
and durability, indicating potential applications in next-gen­
eration lighting or display technologies. Through the utiliza­
tion of coaxial electrospinning, the researchers successfully 
managed the energy transfer between donor and acceptor 
dyes, leading to the emission of uniform white light. This 
study demonstrates the capacity of electrospinning to finely 
tune optical properties and regulate energy transfer, particu­
larly through the implementation of coaxial technology.

a core–shell structure, which enhanced their overall stabil­
ity and performance. Notably, the addition of water-soluble 
fullerene nanoparticles significantly increased the hydro­
philicity of the nanofiber scaffolds, making them more 
compatible with biological environments. The mechanical 
properties of the composite nanofibers were also well-suited 
for tissue-engineering applications, providing an excel­
lent platform for further exploration in biomedical fields. 
In vitro bioimaging experiments using human liver carci­
noma HepG2 cells demonstrated the promising capabilities 
of these composite nanofibers. The intense red fluorescence 
emitted by the fullerene nanoparticles, which was clearly 
visible in the cell nuclei, indicated that the nanoparticles 
were successfully released from the nanofibers and pene­
trated the cells. This efficient cellular uptake suggests that 
the composite nanofibers can be effectively used as scaf­
folds for bioimaging, confirming their potential for use in 
drug delivery and other biomedical applications. Further­
more, the use of both electrospinning and nanoparticle 
methods together in this study highlights the biocompatibil­
ity of these techniques. The combination of these methods 
supports the creation of advanced biomaterials that are not 
only effective for bioimaging but also demonstrate excel­
lent compatibility with living cells, further establishing their 
viability in various medical and industrial applications.
2.6  Thermostability Enhancement
As previously mentioned [38, 39], via electrospinning 
method it is possible to enhance thermal stability. The ther­
mal stability of nanoparticles synthesized through a one-pot 
procedure, particularly fluorescent mesoporous aluminosili­
cates, is also notable [58]. These nanoparticles, created from 
AlOiPr, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and tetraethylam­
monium hydroxide (TEAOH) precursors in the presence 
of Rhodamine B, exhibit excellent thermal and chemical 
stability. When exposed to aqueous acetic acid at 80  °C 
for 12  h, the nanoparticles maintained their integrity and 
fluorescence properties after repeated centrifugation and re-
dispersion. This resilience is attributed to strong interactions 
between the chromophore and the inorganic aluminosilicate 
species, which prevent degradation and preserve the fluores­
cence capability even under harsh conditions. These interac­
tions result in structural modifications during hydrothermal 
treatment and contribute to large Stokes shifts in the fluores­
cence spectra. The nanoparticles also demonstrate enhanced 
stability with longer emission lifetimes, further confirming 
their robustness for use in demanding applications.
Table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of all the 
organoluminophores discussed in the article, including their 
key photoluminescent properties.
combined with the ability to perform single-particle sensing 
and cellular uptake, underscore their tremendous promise 
for accurately imaging the local molecular oxygen concen­
tration within living cells and tissues. The study showed 
the phenomenon of energy-transfer-mediated phosphores­
cence from obtained nanoparticles and its utility in biologi­
cal oxygen sensing. Compared to conventional dye-loaded 
silica or polymer nanoparticles, these conjugated polymer 
nanoparticles exhibit very good light-harvesting capabili­
ties. Single-particle phosphorescence imaging revealed the 
sensitivity of phosphorescence intensity to oxygen partial 
pressure. The nanoparticle sensor’s small size, exceptional 
brightness under both conventional and two-photon excita­
tion, and ratiometric emission, shows the potential of doped 
semiconducting polymer dots for precisely mapping local 
molecular oxygen levels in living cells and tissues.
Electrospinning and FONs methods exhibit similar 
adjustable energy transfer capabilities that enhance lumi­
nescence for various applications. Together, these stud­
ies highlight the versatility of both methods in controlling 
energy transfer, advancing lighting technologies, biological 
imaging, and sensor development.
2.5  Biocompatibility
Recent studies have shown that electrospinning and fluo­
rescent organic nano-dots are suitable for biomedical 
applications.
Latest study [56] introduces a novel enzyme-based 
electrochemical biosensor using fluorescent peptide self-
assembled nanomaterials for sensitive hydrogen perox­
ide detection. By incorporating phenylalanine-tryptophan 
dipeptide (WF-D) into the biosensor, the WF-D nanoparti­
cles provided a biocompatible microenvironment for immo­
bilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which preserved the 
enzyme’s catalytic activity. The electrochemical biosensor 
demonstrated enhanced electron transfer and sensitivity, 
with a detection limit of 1.8 μM for hydrogen peroxide. The 
biocompatibility and excellent electrochemical properties 
of WF-DNPs highlight their potential for safe and effective 
biosensor applications, offering significant advantages over 
conventional electrode materials.
The biocompatibility of both electrospinning and 
nanoparticle methods is clearly demonstrated through the 
successful development of composite nanofibers contain­
ing fullerene nanoparticles, which hold great potential for 
bioimaging applications [57]. In this study, poly(L-lactide) 
(PLLA) nano­fibers were fabricated via a simple electros­
pinning method. The resulting composite nanofibers exhib­
ited uniform morphology with smooth surfaces, and their 
diameters ranged from 300 to 600 nm. Fullerene nanopar­
ticles were encapsulated within these nanofibers, forming

N,N-dimethylformamide which pose environmental and 
health risks due to their toxicity and vapor emissions. These 
solvents also increase production costs and may limit appli­
cation scope due to residual traces [63]. To mitigate these 
issues, alternative methods such as melt electrospinning 
[64], the use of “green” solvents like deep eutectic solvents 
and biodegradable polymer suspensions [65], and solvent-
free techniques like wire melt electrospinning [66] have 
been developed. These innovations enhance the sustainabil­
ity and economic feasibility of the electrospinning process.
Fluorescent organic nano-dots, in turn, are characterized 
by their ability to create biodegradable conjugated poly­
mer particles with enhanced optical properties due to dense 
packing of the luminophore. They also have the capability 
to improve energy transfer efficiency, which proves useful 
in sensing technology. Similar to electrospinning, FONs 
method significantly enhances light emission, enabling the 
detection of organic vapors. Notably, they are easy to prepare 
and do not require special equipment, making them environ­
mentally friendly. Additionally, they exhibit excellent opti­
cal characteristics and biocompatibility. Moreover, FONs 
exhibit enhanced brightness and exceptional photostability, 
along with an extremely long lifespan of luminescence.
The scalability of FONs production is still under devel­
opment; however, there are already several methods that 
show promise for industrial utilization [67, 68].
Fluorescent organic nano-dots derived from traditional 
organic dyes typically exhibit several issues. These include 
the well-known aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) 
effect [69] and a lack of stability in physiological solutions. 
One approach to address these challenges is through AIE 
dyes, which can circumvent the ACQ effect. However, syn­
thesizing AIE dyes is complex, time-intensive, and expen­
sive [19]. The issue with ACQ can be overcome through the 
ES method, which is definitely a significant advancement 
over the FONs method [70].
Research on organic dye nanoparticles is still in its early 
stages, and considerable work needs to be done before they 
can be developed further. For instance, creating techniques 
to create organic dye nanoparticles with the appropriate 
shapes, sizes, and structures remain a crucial task. In fact, it 
is still challenging to create organic dye nanoparticles that 
are as small as inorganic ones—less than 10 nm in diameter. 
The performance and endurance of organic dyes are greatly 
influenced by their thermal stability, which varies greatly 
based on their molecular structure and class. Given that 
dyes with near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are frequently 
more prone to thermal degradation because of their intri­
cate electronic structures and lengthy conjugation systems, 
this factor is particularly important. Long-term use or high 
temperatures can cause NIR dyes to undergo increased ther­
mal stress, which can result in color shifting, a reduction 
3  Discussion
Based on the literature review described earlier, electros­
pinning emerges as a distinctive method for nanomaterial 
production, particularly in the utilization of organic fluoro­
phores. Its versatility is evidenced by the ability to produce 
fibers from a wide range of materials, including polymers, 
composites, and their combinations with inorganic com­
pounds. Furthermore, electrospun fibers exhibit enhanced 
luminescence efficiency and a broader range of emitted col­
ors compared to other methods. These advantages, coupled 
with the capability to produce heat-resistant fibers, make ES 
exceptionally well-suited for optoelectronic applications. 
Notably, electrospinning allows precise orientation control 
of macromolecular chains inside nanofibers, thereby influ­
encing their optical properties. Modern approaches such as 
coaxial electrospinning highlight ES’s capacity to regulate 
energy transfer, particularly in semiconducting materials. 
Additionally, the elasticity of nanofibers and the ability to 
increase photoluminescent polarization further enhance the 
utility of electrospinning in optoelectronic devices.
The advantages of this method do not end there. Proper­
ties such as fiber diameter, morphology, and porosity are 
easily controllable by adjusting parameters like polymer 
concentration, solvent type, and processing conditions, what 
makes ES suitable for any kind of luminescent materials. 
Electrospinning can be readily scaled up for industrial pro­
duction and being a continuous operation with solvent-based 
process, using environmentally friendly solvents, generates 
minimal waste, facilitating large-scale manufacturing.
However, there are several issues with upscaling the pro­
cess of ES. Multi-needle electrospinning, an extension of the 
single-needle method for industrial utilizing, boosts nanofi­
ber production with varying properties, yet faces challenges 
in needle interaction and clogging. Different needle arrange­
ments, including concentric heads, have been explored to 
improve efficiency. Higher voltage is needed due to the 
larger solution mass, with rotating spinnerets reducing clog­
ging risk by employing centrifugal force. Despite advance­
ments, system complexity limits widespread adoption [59, 
60]. Needleless electrospinning was devised to address 
limitations of needle-based methods, offering benefits like 
increased production rates and scalability, with reduced 
clogging risks. However, it demands high voltage to over­
come surface tension and faces challenges in maintaining 
solution viscosity [61]. Nevertheless, scientists are con­
stantly achieving the scalability of ES process conducting 
different approaches. Recent studies demonstrate that many 
companies manufacturing ES equipment now provide solu­
tions for a scalable nanofibers production [62].
Electrospinning often relies on volatile organic solvents 
like tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, and

utilizing techniques like microfluidics-based spinning [74]. 
This method enables the production of submicron-thick 
“noodle-like” fibers, overcoming limitations in pore size 
and fiber scaling. Additionally, electrospinning allows for 
the creation of freestanding porous membranes with more 
controlled pore sizes, making it highly beneficial for appli­
cations in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and organ-on-
a-chip research.
All advantages and disadvantages of both methods are 
collected in Table 2.
4  Conclusion
In conclusion, electrospinning and fluorescent organic nano-
dots (FONs) represent advanced methods for nanomaterial 
production, each offering unique advantages and addressing 
specific challenges in their respective fields.
Electrospinning distinguishes itself through its remark­
able versatility, capable of processing diverse materials such 
as polymers, composites, and hybrid organic–inorganic sys­
tems. This method excels in tailoring nanofiber properties, 
including morphology, porosity, and luminescent behavior, 
by adjusting parameters like polymer concentration and sol­
vent choice. Its ability to enhance luminescence efficiency, 
control energy transfer, and achieve precise macromolecu­
lar chain orientation makes it highly suitable for optoelec­
tronic applications. Additionally, scalability advancements, 
such as needleless and multi-needle setups, have positioned 
electrospinning as a promising tool for industrial produc­
tion. Despite these strengths, challenges persist, including 
clogging in multi-needle systems, high-voltage require­
ments, and complexity in large-scale operations.
In contrast, FONs offer significant promise for bio-imag­
ing and sensing technologies due to their biocompatibility, 
brightness, exceptional photostability, and environmentally 
friendly synthesis processes. The compact nature of FONs 
enhances their optical properties, enabling high-sensitivity 
applications such as organic vapor detection. However, lim­
itations include the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) 
effect and difficulties in maintaining stability in physiologi­
cal conditions. While AIE dyes address the ACQ issue, their 
synthesis remains complex and costly. Furthermore, the 
production scalability of FONs is still under development, 
and the small size required for clinical applications often 
compromises fluorescence intensity, restricting their in vivo 
utility.
Interestingly, electrospinning can complement FONs by 
mitigating some of their drawbacks. For example, ES can 
address ACQ by dispersing luminophores in nanofibers and 
enabling the production of size-controlled materials with 
improved fluorescence [75]. The creation of submicron-thick 
in fluorescence efficiency, or possibly the dye molecules 
breaking down entirely.
When evaluating the durability and effectiveness of 
organic dyes, photochemical stability is an important con­
sideration, particularly when the dyes are exposed to light 
for prolonged periods of time. Many visible-spectrum dyes 
offer adequate photochemical stability for common appli­
cations like common display technologies or fluorescence 
microscopy. These dyes provide steady performance over 
time because they can withstand moderate light levels 
without suffering appreciable deterioration. High light flux 
conditions, on the other hand, present challenges because 
intense or continuous illumination can accelerate photodeg­
radation. Near-infrared (NIR) wavelength dyes are espe­
cially susceptible to breakdown under intense light sources 
because of their complex molecular structures and lower 
photon energies, which makes them less photostable. This 
issue is made even more dire. Shorter operational lifespans, 
spectral shifts, and decreased fluorescence intensity can 
result from this. Therefore, increasing the photochemical 
stability of NIR dyes is crucial for demanding applications 
like photodynamic therapy, laser technologies, and high-
intensity imaging. In order to maintain dye performance 
under difficult lighting conditions, strategies to improve 
stability include protective encapsulation, hybrid material 
development, and molecular modifications [24, 71].
Nanoparticles of conjugated polymers possess hydro­
phobic properties; therefore, they are rapidly absorbed by 
cells and exhibit low cytotoxicity, making them possible to 
use for bio-imaging due to their strong fluorescence [72]. 
There is also a problem in biological utilization of FONs, 
because clinical nanoparticles must be small (5–6 nm) to 
clear through renal purification. Small particles address 
accumulation issues but often lack sufficient fluorescence, 
limiting the safe use of conjugated polymer particle sys­
tems in vivo [47, 73]. Unlike FONs, the electrospinning 
method allows for size reduction, which can be achieved by

fibers and porous membranes extends the applicability of 
electrospinning to areas such as tissue engineering, drug 
delivery, and organ-on-a-chip research [76, 77].
Electrospun fibers demonstrate superior luminescence 
efficiency compared to fluorescent organic nanoparticles 
(FONs), as evidenced by their enhanced photoluminescent 
properties and emission dynamics. This efficiency is attrib­
uted to the fine-tuned polymer compositions and the forma­
tion of smaller polymer domains during the electrospinning 
process, which facilitate more effective energy transfer and 
reduce non-radiative energy losses. The resulting nanofi­
bers display a broader range of emission colors and stronger 
fluorescence. These attributes position electrospun fibers 
as a highly versatile and efficient platform for applications 
in optoelectronics, advanced light sources, and sensory 
materials. In contrast, while FONs offer advantages like 
tunable fluorescence and biocompatibility, their lumines­
cent efficiency is generally lower, making them more suit­
able for specific applications like biomedical imaging and 
drug delivery rather than high-performance light-emitting 
devices.
In summary, while electrospinning is particularly 
advantageous for applications requiring material scalabil­
ity, enhanced luminescence, and structural customization, 
FONs excel in bio-imaging due to their optical properties 
and biocompatibility. Each method has distinct strengths 
and limitations, highlighting the importance of tailoring 
the approach to specific application requirements. These 
complementary technologies hold immense potential for 
advancing fields such as optoelectronics, biomedical imag­
ing, and sensing.
