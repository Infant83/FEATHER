That’s the message coming from a small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the emerging quantum computing industry. [...] “In the public, the quantum computer was portrayed as if it would enable something not currently achievable, which is inaccurate,” he says. “Primarily, it will accelerate existing processes rather than introducing a completely disruptive new application area. So we are evaluating a difference here.”\n\nHarbach’s group has been investigating the relevance of quantum computing to Merck’s work for about six years. While NISQ devices may potentially have uses for some certain highly specialized problems, they’ve concluded that quantum computing will not have a significant impact on industry until fault-tolerance is achieved. Even then, how transformative that impact could be really depends on the specific use case and products a company is working on, says Harbach. [...] ### Aaronson—Welcome, skeptics\n\nThese limitations shouldn’t really be a surprise to anyone who has been paying close attention to quantum computing research, says Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. “There are these claims about how quantum computing will revolutionize machine learning and optimization and finance and all these industries, where I think skepticism was always warranted,” he says. “If people are just now coming around to that, well then, welcome.”", "score": 0.70799106, "raw_content": null, "summary": "CREATE AN ACCOUNTSIGN IN JOIN IEEESIGN IN Close ## Access Thousands of Articles — Completely Free ## Create an account and get exclusive content and features: Save articles, download collections, and post comments — all free!

In an important recent development, the origin of their scaling issues has been characterized via Lie algebras associated to each model, greatly facilitating their study. Complementarily, “geometric” QML models, which are informed by the symmetries of the data they are intended to classify, have been introduced as a leading attempt to ameliorate the poor scaling of generic models.
