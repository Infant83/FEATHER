Alignment score: 88  
Aligned:
- Delivers a narrative review structure (lede → central question → story → open questions) consistent with the “narrative review” focus.
- Provides clear, reader-friendly explanations of the main tension (QPU-as-GPU vs niche hybrid roles) and ties claims back to the limited evidence collected.
- Includes source citations throughout, and flags where statements are only supported by the YouTube transcript or by secondary/market framing sources.
- Appropriately acknowledges run limitations and avoids overstating evidence strength (good provenance appendix).

Gaps/Risks:
- One section appears truncated (“…becom ... [truncated] ...”), which breaks readability and can hide missing reasoning/citations.
- Some claims are a bit interpretive (“quantum-adjacent branding,” “compute that fits”) without enough direct quoting/paraphrase from the cited sources; risk of editorializing beyond evidence.
- Citations are mostly to top-level pages (QCR news landing page) rather than the specific referenced items (e.g., Aramco/Pasqal, Neurawave). This weakens traceability.
- The YouTube transcript is used for conceptual points (encoding bottleneck) but the writeup doesn’t clearly separate “video’s explanation” vs “corroborated by other sources,” except briefly—risk of readers imputing broader support.
- Template fit risk (Quanta-style): it’s close, but could use more concrete scene-setting details and fewer meta-run references in the main narrative (keep provenance mostly in appendix).

Next-step guidance:
- Fix the truncation by restoring the missing paragraph(s) and ensuring every major claim has an adjacent citation.
- Replace generic “QCR news” citations with direct citations to the specific QCR article URLs captured in the run (or explicitly note if only the roundup page was archived).
- Tighten language where evidence is thin: rephrase speculative/branding statements as hypotheses and attribute them (“QCR frames this as…”, “Network World suggests…”).
- Keep the “run limitations” content in the appendix, but remove or minimize “what this run collected” meta-commentary from the lede unless the brief requires it.
