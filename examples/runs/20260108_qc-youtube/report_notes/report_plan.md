Plan (updated):
- [x] Review run scope and provenance — read the instruction, index, and `_job.json`/`_log.txt` to confirm collection parameters, coverage, and limitations  
- [x] Extract authoritative web citations — mine `archive/tavily_search.jsonl` for the most credible, recent QC+AI industry use-case sources; capture outlet/date/URL plus the exact summary snippets  
- [x] Extract narrative claims from YouTube — read `videos.jsonl` and the transcript; pull the key definitional passages and strong claims (with position markers) and tag which require verification  
- [x] Build an evidence-backed outline — map extracted claims into the Quanta-style sections (lede → central question → story so far → how it works → why it matters → open questions)  
- [x] Cross-check and annotate uncertainty — corroborate YouTube claims against the strongest web sources; explicitly note gaps (missing target outlets, off-topic arXiv IDs)  
- [x] Draft the Quanta-style narrative — write the full narrative review with a restrained tone, clear explanations, and inline citations tied to extracted evidence  
- [x] QA + finalize citations and methods note — ensure citation completeness/consistency, add a brief provenance/methods + limitations note, and deliver the final formatted report
