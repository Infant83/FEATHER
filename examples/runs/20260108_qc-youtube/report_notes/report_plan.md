- [ ] Verify report requirements & template constraints — confirm Quanta-style sections, citation style (inline links), and audience/tone from the prompt/template notes  
- [ ] Establish scope from run provenance — read `archive/20260108_qc-youtube-index.md`, `_job.json`, `_log.txt` to state time window, query set, and extraction limitations  
- [ ] Extract primary narrative thread from the YouTube transcript — pull key claims, timestamps, and framing quotes; capture publication metadata from `youtube/videos.jsonl` for accurate citation  
- [ ] Curate and triage web sources from `tavily_search.jsonl` — shortlist the most authoritative URLs (e.g., QED‑C report, Google Quantum AI resources, credible industry coverage), tag each to themes it supports, and discard low-credibility items  
- [ ] Audit arXiv entries for topical fit — review `arxiv/papers.jsonl`, document mismatch/off-topic IDs, and decide whether to exclude or mention as a retrieval/scope limitation  
- [ ] Build an evidence-mapped outline — draft lede, central question, story-so-far chronology, “how it works” explanation, “why it matters,” and 3–5 open questions, each mapped to specific sources  
- [ ] Write the narrative review with citations — synthesize claims cautiously, distinguish “promised” vs “demonstrated,” embed URLs/timestamps, and keep metaphors sparse  
- [ ] Quality & rigor pass — remove hype, make uncertainty explicit, ensure every technical assertion has a supporting citation, and add a transparent “methods/limitations” paragraph consistent with run constraints
