Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.", "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "doi": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16955v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16955v1"}
