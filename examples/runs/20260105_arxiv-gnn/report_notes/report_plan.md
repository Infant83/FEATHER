Plan (updated):

- [x] Load run instruction, index, and provenance logs — confirm scope, inputs, and any mismatches (e.g., off-topic arXiv ID) before drafting  
- [x] Audit metadata indices (OpenAlex/arXiv/Tavily JSONL) — verify duplicates, identify any additional high-value GNN works, and select the final “must-cite” source set  
- [x] Extract core contributions from HISTOGRAPH (W7119235243) — capture problem framing, algorithm/notation, training details, and ablations with exact evidence locations  
- [x] Extract methods/results from interferometer-simulation GNN surrogate (W4417529673) — document graph construction, dataset, evaluation protocol, and key quantitative claims  
- [x] Extract methods/results from ATLAS flavour-tagging GNN (W4417330266) — summarize architecture evolution (GN1/GN2 etc.), inputs/targets, and main performance metrics  
- [x] Synthesize trends, implications, and open problems — compare across papers (depth/oversmoothing, efficiency/surrogates, domain constraints, uncertainty, scalability) and label any adjacent/off-scope items explicitly  
- [ ] **(Missing)** Spot-check extracted text/PDFs for *exact* citation anchors (section/figure/table + page numbers) for the key quantitative claims and propositions  
- [ ] Map synthesis into the technical_deep_dive template — produce section-aligned bullets and citation-ready references (file paths + where in text/PDF to cite)
