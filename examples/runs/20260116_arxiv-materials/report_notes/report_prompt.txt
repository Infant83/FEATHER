Write a Nature-style review centered on the arXiv paper in this run. Use a materials scientist's
perspective to evaluate new strategies for materials research and discovery.

Requirements:
- Audience: materials scientists and R&D leaders.
- Explain the core technical idea, workflow, and why it matters for materials discovery.
- Identify bottlenecks, limitations, and what is still missing.
- Compare with adjacent approaches or baselines (only if supported by sources).
- Use numbered citations; avoid speculation not grounded in the archive.
- If figures are available, integrate them where they clarify the discussion.
- Conclude with 3-5 actionable research directions and next-step questions.
