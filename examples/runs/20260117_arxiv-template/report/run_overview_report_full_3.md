```
Write a technical review that synthesizes the three arXiv papers in this run.
Treat them as a coherent research thread: explain each paper's core contribution,
then connect the ideas into a unified narrative with implications and gaps.

Requirements:
- Audience: domain experts and technical leads.
- Emphasize evidence from the papers only; avoid unsupported speculation.
- Include critical risks, limitations, and open problems.
- Conclude with 3-5 actionable research directions and next-step questions.
- Use numbered citations and keep tone professional and analytic.
