Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for next-generation, high-
efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet their rational design is hampered by the
high computational cost of accurate excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive
benchmark study validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods—specifically
sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB—for the high-throughput screening of TADF materials. Using
an unprecedentedly large dataset of 747 experimentally characterized emitters, our framework
demonstrates a computational cost reduction of over 99 % compared to conventional TD-DFT,
while maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson r ≈0.82 for ∆EST),
validating their utility for relative molecular ranking. Validation against 312 experimental ∆ESTvalues
reveals a mean absolute error of approximately 0.17 eV, a discrepancy attributed to the vertical
approximation inherent to the HTS protocol, underscoring the methods’ role in screening rather
than quantitative prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key design
principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures
and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of 50◦to 90◦for efficient TADF. Principal
Component Analysis reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with
three components capturing nearly 90 % of the variance. This work establishes these semi-empirical
methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set
of data-driven design rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science
community.

INTRODUCTION
Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) utilizing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have
emerged as a third generation of optoelectronic devices, promising near 100% internal quantum efficiency by effectively
harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons via Reverse Intersystem Crossing (RISC) [1–3]. The key photophysical
prerequisite for efficient TADF is a small singlet-triplet energy gap (∆EST ≤0.3 eV), typically achieved through
molecular designs that promote a spatial separation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leading to excited states with substantial Charge-Transfer (CT) character
[4, 5].
The rational computational design and discovery of novel TADF emitters, however, face significant theoretical
challenges [6, 7]. Conventional ab initio methods, such as high-level state function theory (e.g., SCS-CC2 or STEOM-
DLPNO-CCSD), often required for quantitative accuracy, especially for complex Multi-Resonance (MR-TADF) systems)
[8, 9], are computationally prohibitive for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of the vast chemical space relevant
to OLED materials [10]. Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT), while more efficient, suffers from
well-documented limitations, particularly its tendency to underestimate the energy of highly delocalized CT states and
its known failures in contexts requiring multireference character or the consideration of environmental polarization
effects [11–14]. Furthermore, calculating the precise ∆ESTin solution, a critical metric for TADF performance, ideally
requires computationally expensive approaches like the State-Specific Polarizable Continuum Model (SS-PCM) or
Restricted Open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) methods, which account for the differential stabilization of S1 and T1 states
in polar environments [15, 16].
To address this fundamental dilemma—the need for robust predictions across thousands of molecules constrained
by the cost and accuracy shortcomings of current methods—Simplified Quantum Chemistry (sQC) approaches have
gained traction [17]. In this context, the combination of eXtended Tight-Binding (xTB) methods with simplified
response theory offers a compelling pathway forward [18–20]. Specifically, the simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation
(sTDA) and simplified TD-DFT (sTD-DFT) methods, when coupled with the efficient xTB Hamiltonian (sTDA-xTB

and sTD-DFT-xTB), provide a highly scalable framework capable of treating systems with hundreds to thousands of
atoms [18, 21]. This capability is achieved by approximating two-electron integrals and truncating the configuration
interaction (CI) space, leading to computational cost reductions often exceeding 99% compared to conventional
TD-DFT calculations.
This work presents a rigorous, large-scale validation of the semi-empirical sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB methods
as tools for the high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of TADF emitters. We leverage a uniquely extensive dataset
comprising 747 experimentally characterized TADF molecules [22], moving significantly beyond the limitations of small
datasets previously assessed [23, 24]. In doing so, we compare the performance of these methods against each other
and experimental data, assess their ability to capture solvent effects relevant to device environments, and evaluate the
computational cost-benefit ratio relative to conventional approaches.
We systematically evaluate the fidelity of sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB by comparison against experimental
data, including 312 experimental ∆ESTvalues and 213 emission wavelengths (λPL) [22]. This massive validation effort
establishes the strengths and limitations of sQC methods for predicting key TADF properties. We confirm the strong
internal consistency of the sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB variants (Pearson r ≈0.82 for ∆EST), demonstrating
their equivalence for the critical task of relative molecular ranking essential for HTS, despite acknowledging known
quantitative inaccuracies for absolute values (MAE ∼0.17 eV against experiment for ∆EST) [25]. We explicitly
investigate the impact of the approximations inherent to the sQC approach, including the hybrid use of GFN2-xTB
geometries (optimized for ground-state properties) and the implicit solvent model ALPB (a linearized Poisson-
Boltzmann model) for calculating excited-state properties in toluene [26, 27]. We quantify the statistically significant,
albeit modest, influence of solvent effects on photophysical properties. Our analysis confirms that the computational
efficiency achieved enables the processing of hundreds of molecules rapidly, providing essential benchmarking data and
methodological guidelines for accelerating TADF emitter discovery pipelines [28]. We show that the vast majority of
property variance can be captured by a few components, suggesting a low-dimensional and targetable design space.
The manuscript is organized as follows: Section II details the computational methodology, including the protocols
for geometry optimization (GFN2-xTB) [29], excited-state calculation (sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB), and the definition
of molecular and photophysical metrics. Section III presents the results of the comprehensive benchmarking study,
discussing the method consistency, predictive accuracy against experimental data, and the influence of solvent effects.
Finally, Section IV summarizes the findings and proposes future research directions, particularly the integration of
these validated sQC methods with Machine Learning techniques for predictive modeling of TADF dynamics.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
The aim of this work is to establish a robust and computationally efficient methodology for the high-throughput
virtual screening of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This protocol integrates accelerated
semi-empirical methods from the extended tight-binding (xTB) family for geometry optimization and subsequent excited-
state property calculations, enabling the analysis of a large and diverse chemical space. A schematic representation of
the workflow is presented in Figure 1.
A.
Dataset and conformational sampling
Our benchmark dataset comprises 747 TADF emitters extracted from the literature using automated text mining
[22]. The set spans diverse molecular architectures, including donor-acceptor (D-A), multiple donor-acceptor, and
multi-resonance (MR) systems. Initial 3D structures were generated from SMILES strings using RDKit [30]. The
complete molecular list is provided in Supporting Information Table S1.
A systematic conformational search for each molecule was performed using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble
Sampling Tool (CREST version 3.0) [31, 32] coupled with the GFN2-xTB semi-empirical Hamiltonian using the xTB
program (version 6.7.0) [26, 33]. GFN2-xTB is a second-generation tight-binding quantum chemical method specifically
parameterized for accurate molecular structures, conformational energies, and noncovalent interactions, making it
highly suitable for describing the complex geometries of TADF emitters [17]. The lowest-energy conformer identified by
CREST was then subjected to a final, tight geometry optimization at the GFN2-xTB level to obtain the equilibrium
structure on the singlet electronic ground state (S0).

optimisation via xTB for the singlet ground state S0 and the triplet state T1. It allows the extraction of the relaxed triplet
excitation energy. Simplified time-dependent DFT calculation with sTDA/sTD-DFT extracts the vertical singlet-triplet gap, the
relaxed triplet-triplet gap, the oscillator strength, the vertical excitation energy and the fluorescence absorption and emission
spectra, while incorporating solvent effects to enhance the realism of our simulations. The Stokes shift is evaluated and then
allows the relaxed singlet-triplet gap to be estimated.
B.
Excited-state calculations and hybrid protocol
Excited-state properties were calculated using the geometries optimized at the S0 GFN2-xTB level through two highly
efficient quantum chemistry methods based on the extended tight-binding (xTB) framework: the simplified Tamm-
Dancoff approximation (sTDA-xTB) [18] and simplified time-dependent density functional theory (sTD-DFT-xTB)
[19, 20]. Notably, these excited-state calculations employ a non-self-consistent extended tight-binding Hamiltonian,
distinct from the GFN2-xTB Hamiltonian used for ground-state geometry optimization [29]. The sTDA-xTB and
sTD-DFT-xTB methods utilize a specialized Hamiltonian and an extended atomic orbital (AO) basis set parameterized
for robust and rapid prediction of absorption and emission spectra [17].
This hybrid protocol, which adopts GFN2-xTB optimized geometries for a single-point sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB
calculation, represents a pragmatic approximation enabling the high computational efficiency necessary for high-
throughput screening (HTS). While excited-state optimized geometries would be preferable for accurately modeling
adiabatic properties [12, 14], this approach preserves the relative rankings and qualitative trends critical for virtual
screening, achieving computational speed-ups exceeding 99 % compared to conventional TD-DFT [34].
We explicitly acknowledge that the GFN2-xTB and the xTB Hamiltonian used for sTDA/sTD-DFT (denoted as
xTB4sTDA) stem from distinct parametrizations and basis sets [35–37]. The workflow’s key assumption is that the
GFN2-xTB optimized ground-state geometry provides a sufficiently accurate vertical approximation (S0 geometry) to
support rapid and reliable single-point excited-state computations. This separation is justified as the main goal is
qualitative trend screening and relative molecular ranking across hundreds of compounds, delivering a remarkable
computational cost reduction of roughly 99 % relative to conventional TD-DFT [7, 34]. For precise absolute energies or
adiabatic excited-state geometries, higher-level, more computationally demanding methods would be necessary [38].
C.
Solvent effects modeling
To model the influence of the molecular environment, all calculations were performed in both the gas phase and in
solution. We employed the analytical linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (ALPB) implicit solvation model [27], with toluene
(ε = 2.38) selected as a representative low-polarity solvent commonly used in experimental studies of TADF emitters.


===== PAGE 4 =====

We acknowledge that this model relies on the ground-state electronic density and does not fully capture dynamic
solvent reorganization effects pertinent to charge-transfer states. For quantitative accuracy, state-specific (SS-PCM) or
restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) methods would be necessary [39, 40]. However, the ALPB model provides a
computationally tractable and consistent approach for assessing solvent-induced trends across our large dataset.
D.
Electronic structure and property analysis
From the excited-state calculations, we directly obtained the vertical excitation energies of the lowest singlet (ES1)
and triplet (ET1) states, from which the singlet-triplet energy gap was calculated:
∆EST = ES1 −ET1.
(1)
The dimensionless oscillator strength (fS1) for the S0 →S1 transition was also computed as a proxy for the radiative
decay rate.
Given that direct geometry optimization of the S1 state is not implemented in the employed semi-empirical framework,
an approximation was necessary to estimate emission properties. We first calculated the relaxed triplet excitation
energy by optimizing the T1 state geometry at the GFN2-xTB level. The geometric relaxation energy for the triplet
state, ∆Erelax(T1), was then assumed to be equal to the Stokes shift of the S1 state. This physically-grounded
approximation allowed for the estimation of the relaxed S1 energy, and consequently, the emission wavelength (λPL).
The detailed equations for this estimation are provided in the Supporting Information.
To gain physical insight into the electronic structure, particularly the degree of charge-transfer (CT) character, we
analyzed the frontier molecular orbitals. Using the Multiwfn package [41], we quantified the spatial separation between
the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals via two key descriptors: the overlap
integral (S′
HL) and the centroid distance between their respective electron densities (DHL) [42, 43]. These metrics
provide a quantitative measure of the electronic decoupling central to the TADF mechanism.
E.
Validation, statistical analysis, and computational cost
To validate our computational protocol, we benchmarked the performance of the sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB
methods against a large set of experimental data extracted from the literature. The validation set consisted of
312 experimental ∆ESTvalues and 213 experimental emission wavelengths (λPL), standardized to eV and nm units,
respectively. The performance of the semi-empirical methods was rigorously assessed by comparing their predictions to
these experimental values, as well as by comparing the two xTB variants against each other.
The statistical analysis employed a suite of standard metrics to quantify accuracy and correlation, including Pearson
(r) and Spearman (ρ) correlation coefficients to assess linear and monotonic trends, respectively. Predictive accuracy
was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Systematic differences between
methods or against experimental data were examined with paired Student’s t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests. Distribution normality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests, while solvent effects were analyzed
through paired comparisons with Cohen’s d effect sizes. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was
performed on standardized property vectors to identify dominant variance components. All statistical analyses were
conducted using Python with the SciPy and scikit-learn libraries.
All calculations were performed on a workstation equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6136 CPU and 128 GB of RAM.
The semi-empirical protocol demonstrated exceptional efficiency, with the total computational time for all 747 molecules
amounting to approximately 614 CPU hours. A representative breakdown per molecule includes conformational
search (approximately 20–27 minutes), GFN2-xTB geometry optimization (approximately 1 min), and excited-state
calculations (11 s for sTDA-xTB; 33 seconds for sTD-DFT-xTB). For comparison, a conventional TD-DFT calculation
(e.g., CAM-B3LYP/def2-TZVP) for a single molecule is estimated to require approximately 50 CPU hours. Our hybrid
approach thus represents a computational cost reduction of over 99 %, a critical enabling factor for high-throughput
screening.
To ensure full reproducibility and facilitate future research, the complete computational dataset, including all
molecular structures (SMILES), optimized geometries, calculated properties, and the analysis scripts used in this
study, are made publicly available at [Repository URL, to be added upon publication].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The large-scale application of the hybrid GFN2-xTB/sTDA(sTD-DFT)-xTB protocol to 747 experimentally charac-
terized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters constitutes the core validation of this work. This
dataset size, unprecedented for semi-empirical methods in TADF studies, allows for rigorous statistical analysis of
method reliability, scalability, and the extraction of robust design principles.
A.
Overview of the computational dataset
The architectural diversity of the 747-molecule set yields substantial variability in the computed photophysical
properties, as summarized in Table I. The singlet-triplet energy gap (∆EST) calculated with sTDA-xTB in the gas
phase shows a mean of 0.328 eV with a large standard deviation of 0.204 eV, indicating the presence of both highly
efficient TADF candidates and molecules with large gaps. The dataset spans a wide spectral range, with predicted
photoluminescence wavelengths (λPL) from the deep-blue to the near-infrared region (343 nm to 2 565 nm). Oscillator
strengths (f12) are broadly dispersed, with a median of 0.27, which is consistent with the significant charge-transfer
character typical of many TADF systems. Overall, the dataset captures a comprehensive spectrum of TADF molecular
architectures and photophysical behaviors, making it highly suitable for robustly benchmarking the computational
methods.

Internal consistency and screening reliability
A primary requirement for a high-throughput screening method is internal consistency. We compared the predictions
from sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB across the entire dataset to ensure their interchangeability for relative molecular
ranking. The results, summarized in Tables II and III and visualized in Figure 4, confirm a strong correlation between
the two methods.
For the key metric ∆EST, the methods show a Pearson correlation of r = 0.82 in the gas phase with a mean absolute
error (MAE) of only 0.023 eV. This small deviation is well within typical experimental or higher-level theoretical
uncertainties, confirming that either method provides equivalent relative predictions suitable for a virtual screening
campaign. The singlet oscillator strengths (f12) show exceptional agreement (r > 0.98), indicating that both methods
consistently capture the magnitude of transition dipole moments. This high internal consistency validates the use of
these computationally inexpensive methods for the primary goal of this work: identifying trends and ranking candidate
molecules.

Validation against experimental data
To assess the predictive capability of our semi-empirical framework for real-world applications, we performed an
extensive validation study comparing the sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB predictions against a large, curated dataset
of experimental literature values. This external validation is the most critical test of the methodology’s utility for

Emission wavelength predictions
The statistical performance for λPL predictions is summarized in Table V. The methods demonstrate a moderate-
to-strong correlation with experimental values, with Pearson coefficients ranging from r = 0.56 to r = 0.69. The
best overall performance is achieved by sTD-DFT in toluene, with an MAE of 78.8 nm and a Pearson r of 0.692.
The negative R2 values indicate that a simple linear model does not perfectly capture the absolute values, which is
expected for a high-throughput method using several approximations. However, the strong and statistically significant
(p < 10−18) Pearson correlations confirm that both methods reliably capture the relative trends in emission wavelengths
across the diverse molecular set.
The correlation plots in Figure 5 visualize this trend, showing that while there is scatter, the data generally follows
the identity line. The linear regression slopes, consistently greater than 1, suggest a systematic overestimation of
emission energies (underestimation of wavelengths), particularly for long-wavelength emitters, a known challenge for
simplified methods describing CT states. The error distributions shown in Figure 6 are approximately Gaussian and
centered near zero, confirming the absence of a strong directional bias.

Singlet–triplet gap predictions
Predicting the singlet-triplet gap, the most critical parameter for TADF, is inherently more challenging due to
the small energy scales involved. As detailed in Table VI, the quantitative accuracy is modest, with an MAE of
approximately 0.17 eV. The Pearson correlation with experimental data is weak but statistically significant (r ≈0.18,
p < 0.002 for gas-phase methods).
This weaker quantitative performance is an expected consequence of the vertical approximation and the semi-
empirical nature of the methods, which struggle to capture the subtle balance of exchange and correlation effects that
define the ∆EST. The correlation plot in Figure 7 reveals considerable scatter, particularly for molecules with very

small experimental gaps (< 0.1 eV), a regime where both computational and experimental uncertainties are high. The
error distributions in Figure 8 are centered near zero but are broad, highlighting the challenge of quantitative prediction.
However, the statistically significant positive correlation confirms that the methods still provide a better-than-random
capability to identify trends and rank molecules by their relative ∆EST, which is the primary goal of the screening
protocol.

FIG. 7. Correlation between predicted and reference singlet–triplet energy gaps (∆EST) for 296 TADF molecules. Despite
considerable scatter, the statistically significant positive correlations (p < 0.02) confirm that the semi-empirical methods can
correctly capture qualitative trends in ∆ESTacross the dataset. The regression slopes are significantly less than 1, indicating a
systematic underestimation of larger gaps.
3.
Comparative analysis and implications for high-throughput screening
A direct comparison of the methods is summarized in Table VII and Figure 9. For λPL, sTD-DFT in toluene offers
the best correlation with experiment, while for ∆EST, sTD-DFT in the gas phase performs marginally better. The
phase-dependent behavior suggests that the two methods respond differently to the implicit solvation model. However,
given their strong internal consistency and comparable performance against experimental trends, both sTDA-xTB and
sTD-DFT-xTB are validated as suitable tools for large-scale TADF screening. sTDA’s lower computational cost makes
it particularly attractive for exploring vast chemical spaces, while sTD-DFT may be preferred when slightly higher
fidelity for ∆ESTis desired.
Crucially, this large-scale validation demonstrates that the semi-empirical protocol, despite its quantitative limitations,
successfully achieves its primary objective: it provides a computationally affordable means to reliably rank large

D.
Computational efficiency and scalability for HTS
A central justification for employing the semi-empirical protocol is its computational efficiency, which is a prerequisite
for any HTS campaign. Our analysis demonstrates a dramatic reduction in computational cost of over 99 % compared
to conventional TD-DFT approaches (e.g., CAM-B3LYP/def2-TZVP).
The total computational cost for the entire 747-molecule dataset, including conformational searches and excited-state
calculations in both gas phase and solvent, was approximately 614 CPU hours on modest hardware. In contrast,
performing equivalent calculations with TD-DFT would be conservatively estimated at over 37 000 CPU hours. This
immense gain in efficiency enables the screening of hundreds to thousands of candidate molecules, a scale that is simply
intractable with first-principles methods. This scalability is not just an incremental improvement but a transformative
capability, opening the door to data-driven discovery and the exploration of vast, untapped regions of the chemical
space for TADF emitters.

E.
Impact of implicit solvation on excited states
The inclusion of an implicit solvent model (ALPB for toluene) allows for a first-order approximation of environmental
effects. The shift from gas phase to toluene is statistically significant for all properties, including ∆EST(p < 10−6), as
shown in Table VIII. However, the magnitude of these shifts is modest (Cohen’s d effect sizes of 0.2 to 0.3), suggesting
that the linear-response, ground-state solvation model is insufficient to capture the full stabilization of the highly
polarized S1 charge-transfer state. This is a recognized methodological compromise, accepted to maintain the high
efficiency required for a large-scale screening. Analysis of the solvent-induced electron density redistribution (Figure 10)
confirms this picture: while the net charge transfer is minimal, the internal electronic reorganization and the change
in dipole moment are substantial, underscoring that solvation is a key factor, even if its effect is only qualitatively
captured here.

Global property correlations and dimensionality reduction
To uncover the fundamental variables governing TADF properties, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was
employed to distill the high-dimensional property space of the 747 TADF emitters into its most significant underlying
variables. The analysis reveals a remarkably low-dimensional design space, as detailed in Tables IX and X. In both
gas and toluene phases, the first three principal components (PCs) collectively capture approximately 88 % of the
total variance. The dominance of these few components is significant: the first two alone account for over 68 % of
the variance (Figure 11), confirming that the vast majority of photophysical behavior is governed by a limited set of
orthogonal factors.
This low-dimensional structure is a consequence of strong underlying correlations between the calculated properties,
which are visualized directly in the correlation heatmaps shown in Figures 12 and 13. These maps provide a detailed
visualization of the pairwise relationships that underpin the principal components. Several key chemical and physical
trends are immediately apparent. For instance, a strong negative correlation is observed between the D-A torsional
angle and HOMO-LUMO overlap, quantitatively confirming that twisting the molecular backbone is an effective
strategy for spatially separating the frontier orbitals. The expected inverse relationship between ∆ESTand λPL is also
clearly visible. Notably, a comparison between the gas phase and toluene simulations shows a general attenuation
of correlation strengths in the solvent phase, indicating that the polarizable environment modulates these intrinsic
electronic relationships. Together, the PCA and heatmap analyses confirm that the complex, multi-parameter challenge
of TADF emitter design can be rationalized by focusing on a few key properties related to energy gaps, charge
separation, and radiative coupling efficiency.

Structure-property relationships: architecture and torsional angles
Having established the reliability and efficiency of our protocol for relative ranking, we leveraged the 747-molecule
dataset to extract statistically robust structure-property relationships. Our analysis focused on two key structural
levers: the overall molecular architecture and the donor-acceptor (D-A) torsional geometry.
First, a clear hierarchy of performance emerges when molecules are categorized by their architecture (Table XI and
Figure 14). Donor–Acceptor–Donor (D-A-D) systems demonstrate statistically superior potential, exhibiting a mean
∆EST of 0.304 eV, which is significantly lower than that of simple D-A (0.369 eV) or pure donor systems (>0.4 eV).
This confirms that architectural designs promoting charge delocalization across multiple donor sites are highly effective
at minimizing the exchange integral, a cornerstone of TADF theory [6, 23].
Second, our large-scale analysis provides statistical validation for the widely held ’design rule’ that an optimal
D-A torsional angle exists. As shown in Figure 15, molecules with torsional angles between 50◦and 90◦have a
4.2 percentage point higher probability of being efficient TADF emitters (defined as ∆EST < 0.3 eV) compared to
those outside this range—a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001). This optimal range represents a critical
compromise: the twist is large enough to enforce HOMO-LUMO separation and minimize the exchange energy, but
not so extreme as to completely decouple the donor and acceptor, which would diminish the oscillator strength.

the TADF property space. The slightly broader distribution in the toluene phase (b) reflects the solvent-induced modulation of
molecular properties, but the overall structure of the design space is preserved.

However, the correlation between torsional angle alone and ∆ESTis weak across the entire dataset (Figure 16).
This indicates that while torsional geometry is a critical tuning parameter, the overall molecular architecture is the
primary determinant of TADF potential. For instance, the superior D-A-D architecture performs well across a broad
range of torsional angles, underscoring its robustness. This highlights that the most effective design strategy involves
first selecting a high-performance architecture (e.g., D-A-D) and then fine-tuning its properties through geometric
modifications that enforce an optimal torsional angle.

FIG. 12. Correlation heatmap of key TADF properties for 747 molecules in the gas phase. The color scale denotes the Pearson
correlation coefficient. The map highlights several key relationships: (i) the strong positive correlation (r ≈0.82) between
∆ESTvalues predicted by sTDA and sTD-DFT, confirming their internal consistency; (ii) the strong negative correlation between
torsional angle and HOMO-LUMO overlap, validating the geometric basis for electronic decoupling; and (iii) the moderate
negative correlation between ∆ESTand λPL, reflecting the fundamental energy gap law.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have performed the largest-scale computational benchmark of semi-empirical xTB methods to
date for TADF emitter screening, establishing a validated, high-throughput framework for the rational design of
next-generation optoelectronic materials. By applying a hybrid computational protocol to 747 experimentally known
molecules, we have moved beyond case-by-case analysis to extract statistically robust, quantitative design principles.
Our key findings can be summarized as follows:
• Methodological validation. The sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB methods are validated as reliable and
computationally efficient tools for the relative ranking of TADF candidates. They exhibit strong internal
consistency (MAE for ∆EST< 0.03 eV between methods) and achieve a transformative cost reduction of over 99 %
compared to conventional TD-DFT, making large-scale screening feasible on modest computational resources.
• Predictive accuracy and limitations. While the methods successfully capture qualitative trends, their
quantitative accuracy for absolute prediction is limited by the inherent approximations of the HTS protocol,
particularly the vertical approximation. The mean absolute error against experimental ∆ESTvalues is approxi-
mately 0.17 eV, reinforcing that the primary strength of this framework lies in screening and trend analysis, not

Pearson Correlation
FIG. 13. Correlation heatmap of key TADF properties for 747 molecules in toluene solvent. When compared with the gas phase
results (Figure 12), this map reveals a general attenuation of correlation strengths (e.g., the sTDA vs sTD-DFT ∆ESTcorrelation
drops to r ≈0.61). This indicates that the polarizable solvent environment introduces additional complexity and modulates the
intrinsic electronic and photophysical property relationships observed in vacuum.
in yielding quantitatively precise spectroscopic data.
• Data-driven design rules. Our large-scale analysis provides statistical validation for key design principles. We
confirm that D-A-D architectures are statistically superior to simple D-A and other motifs. Furthermore, we
identify an optimal D-A torsional angle window of 50◦to 90◦that effectively balances the competing requirements
of small ∆ESTand high oscillator strength.
• Low-dimensional design space. Principal Component Analysis demonstrates that the vast chemical diversity
of TADF emitters can be described by a low-dimensional property space, where nearly 90 % of the variance is
captured by just three principal components. This suggests that the design challenge is highly constrained and
can be effectively navigated by optimizing a few key orthogonal properties.
The broader impact of this study is the provision of a scalable and validated protocol that bridges the gap between
slow, high-accuracy methods and the practical need to explore vast chemical spaces. This work not only provides
essential benchmarking data and methodological guidelines for the community but also identifies a curated list of
high-priority molecular candidates for future experimental synthesis.
Future work should build upon this foundation. The immediate next step is the experimental validation of the most
promising candidates identified herein. From a theoretical perspective, future refinements should focus on developing

of spin-orbit coupling on representative subsets to refine the mechanistic understanding of the RISC process. Finally,
the extensive and well-characterized dataset generated in this study provides an ideal training ground for developing
machine learning models capable of further accelerating the discovery of novel, high-performance TADF materials.
Ultimately, this study provides a validated toolkit, a comprehensive set of data-driven design rules, and a curated
list of promising candidates, significantly advancing the goal of rational, accelerated discovery of next-generation
optoelectronic materials.

Torsional Angle vs EST Correlations
FIG. 16. Correlation between D-A torsional angles and the calculated ∆ESTfor all 747 molecules. The lack of a strong linear
trend (Pearson r ≈−0.007) illustrates that while an optimal range for the torsional angle exists, it is not the sole determinant
of the singlet-triplet gap. Molecular architecture and electronic factors play a dominant, confounding role.
