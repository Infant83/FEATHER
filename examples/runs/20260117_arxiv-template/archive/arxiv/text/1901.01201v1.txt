Abstract: Phosphorescent organic-light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) are widely used in the 
display industry. In PhOLEDs, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes are the most widespread 
triplet emitter dopants to attain red, e.g., Ir(piq)3 (piq = 1-phenylisoquinoline), and green, e.g., 
Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) emission, whilst obtaining operative deep-blue emitters is 
still one of the major challenges. When designing new emitters two main characteristics, 
besides colours, should be targeted: high photostability and large photoluminescence 
efficiencies. To date, these are very often optimized experimentally in a trial-and-error 
manner. Instead, accurate predictive tools would be highly desirable. In this contribution, we 
present a general approach for computing the photoluminescence lifetimes and efficiencies of 
Ir(III) complexes by considering all possible competing excited state deactivation processes, 
and importantly explicitly including the strongly temperature-dependent ones. This approach 
is based on state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations with excited state decay rate 
formalism and the kinetic modelling, which is shown to be both efficient and reliable for a 
broad palette of Ir(III) complexes, i.e., from yellow/orange to deep-blue emitters.

Introduction 
Molecular materials modeling and virtual screening approaches are becoming fundamental 
tools in the design of new molecules with tailored properties,1,2 including electroluminescent 
molecules.3,4 To boost the interest of high-throughput virtual screening approaches, robust 
computational approaches accurately predicting all key properties are first needed. PhOLEDs, 
the so-called second generation of OLEDs,5 are still the most widespread OLEDs technology 
in display industry. Therefore, enormous industrial and academic efforts are devoted to the 
development of new electroluminescent molecular materials with optimal performances for 
PhOLEDs, and in particular to the elaboration of highly-efficient and photostable deep-blue 
phosphors. Recent reports showed that external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of up to 30% can 
be obtained using horizontally oriented heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes.6,7,8 Due to the intricate 
nature of the competing excited state deactivation processes in Ir(III) complexes,9,10 the 
accurate computation of the photoluminescence efficiency, which is the main factor 
determining the EQE values in PhOLEDs, has remained elusive up to now. In practice, the 
efficient triplet harvesting requires an emissive triplet excited state presenting a substantial 
metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) character,11,12 in order to favor the radiative drainage 
to the electronic ground state over the nonradiative one. In addition, the photoluminescence 
lifetimes and efficiencies are temperature-dependent,10 due to the presence of thermally 
activated nonradiative channels associated to the population of triplet metal-centered (3MC) 
states. The competing deactivation channels for Ir(III) complexes are illustrated in Scheme 
1a, whereas the corresponding kinetic model is presented in Scheme 1b. Having in mind this 
kinetic model the photoluminescence efficiencies (1) and lifetimes (2) can be expressed as

where kr is the 3MLCT→S0 radiative decay rate, kISC is the 3MLCT→S0 nonradiative intersystem 
crossing rate (ISC) which in principle is temperature dependent through vibration population but 
here it is much less pronounced because the relevant vibrational modes are of high frequency, 
and knr(T) is the strongly temperature-dependent nonradiative decay rate associated with the 
population of the 3MC well. The recent progresses in theoretical methods and algorithms enabled 
the computation of phosphorescence decay rates at the first-principles level.13,14,15 Despite these 
progresses, the calculations of all the nonradiative counterparts present in Eq. (1) has remained 
more cumbersome, especially the temperature-dependent decay rate, i.e., knr(T). Having in mind 
that OLEDs should work at ambient temperatures, the accurate calculation of all decay rates is 
mandatory for practical applications. In fact, the two groups involved in the present work have 
provided preliminary kinetic models for estimating the photoluminescence efficiencies of red-to-
green16,17 and green-to-blue18 Ir(III) complexes, respectively. A general approach valid for all 
kind of complexes regardless of their emission color, is still missing in the literature. Here, we 
fill this gap by reporting a general computational protocol to predict the photoluminescence 
lifetimes and efficiencies of Ir(III) complexes at any given temperature. In contrast to previous 
models, this protocol is in principle valid for all Ir(III) complexes, regardless of their emission 
color, and it is potentially transferable to other phosphor materials with similar excited state 
features, e.g., square planar Pt(II) complexes. Importantly, this protocol does not rely on 
simplified kinetic models and does not require knowing beforehand any experimental

information about the complexes, so that it can be integrated in the automated in silico 
prescreening of promising PhOLEDs materials. 
 
Scheme 1. a) Schematic representation of the competing excited state deactivation processes of 
Ir(III) complexes: emission from the 3MLCT state (kr) competes with the 3MLCT→S0 
nonradiative decay (kISC) and with thermally activated nonradiative decay (knr(T)). The latter 
channel is characterized by population of the 3MC well through a transition state (TS) and the 
irreversible recovery of the ground state (S0) geometry through the S0/3MC minimum energy 
crossing point (MECP). Along this channel, the main geometrical changes occur from the 
3MLCT (pseudo-octahedral) to the 3MC (trigonal bipyramid) geometry, through breaking of one 
Ir-N bond (see Scheme 1b, top). Small geometrical changes occur along the 3MC→MECP 
transformation, the latter geometry exhibiting a further distorted trigonal bipyramid arrangement. 
Thus, the barrier to populate the TS (Ea) is usually the rate limiting step of this channel. For more 
details see Ref. 18. b) Kinetic model for the excited-state deactivation of Ir(III) complexes. Note 
that singlet excited states are not included, as the intersystem crossing processes present a 100% 
efficiency in these complexes.11

To test the validity of this protocol we have selected three Ir(III) complexes (see Scheme 2), 
i.e., fac-Ir(F2ppy)(ppz)2 (1, where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine and ppz = phenylpyrazole), fac-
Ir(ppy)3 (2) and fac-Ir(flpy)3 (3, where flpy = 2-(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)pyridine), that 
emit in the blue, green and yellow/orange regions, respectively; and for which extensive 
experimental data is available.10,19,20 Herein, for 1-3, the kr decay rates are determined with the 
Einstein relationship and the kISC decay rates are computed using the thermal vibration 
correlation function (TVCF) rate theory in combination with time-dependent density functional 
theory (TD-DFT) and DFT calculations. Regarding the calculation of kr, it is generally accepted 
that perturbative approaches yield systematically slightly lower rates than non-perturbative 
schemes21 or those that include spin-vibronic countributions.17 However, these two latter 
sophisticated approaches are computationally more demanding, and would limit the general 
applicability of our protocol. Moreover, it was previously found for Ir(III) complexes,22  that an 
optimal computational protocol based on a perturbative scheme can still provide kr values in 
good agreement with the experimental ones and is therefore selected herein (see details in the 
Computational Methods). The computation of the kISC decay rates using the TVCF formalism has 
previously shown to yield robust results.17,23 Finally, the knr(T) decay rate is computed with 
canonical variational transition state theory (CVT),24 based on the computed DFT energy profiles 
for the thermally activated nonradiative decay (see Scheme 1a). As recently reported for these 
complexes,18 the most suited kinetic model for this decay channel involves equilibration between 
the 3MLCT and 3MC states before irreversible return to the ground state. Thus,

Using the steady state approximation and assuming this complex kinetic scenario, the knr(T) 
decay rate has the following form 
𝑘34 (𝑇) = 𝑘5𝑘6/(𝑘5 + 𝑘9)

where ka, kb and kc (i.e., kn) can be expressed as

En being the activation energy, An its corresponding preexponential factor, and kB the 
Boltzmann constant. Computing all rates in Eq. (4) becomes easily prohibitive for practical 
purposes. As detailed in Ref. 18, the rate limiting step is usually the 3MLCT→3MC 
transformation (i.e., ka), which involves the breaking of one Ir-N bond (see Scheme 1b). Under 
these circumstances, Eq. (4) can straightforwardly be approximated as 
𝑘34(𝑇) = 𝐴A𝐴exp(−𝐸6/𝑘B𝑇)

where A0 stands for a temperature-dependent Boltzmann prefactor in accordance to (4), i.e.,

and A is the preexponential factor for the MLCT→3MC transformation, which is computed 
with the CVT dynamics. Eq. 6 is thus capable to cover both a pre-equilibrated scenario as well as 
a non pre-equilibrated one. Complete details on the TVCF and CVT procedures can be found in 
the Methods section. Below we first discuss the blue emitter (1) in details, before presenting the 
results for the green (2) and yellow/orange (3) emitters.

Results and discussion 
Blue-emitter case [fac-Ir(F2ppy)(ppz)2 (1)]: The temperature-dependent photoluminescence 
properties of complex 1 were exhaustively investigated by Thompson and coworkers.10 Relevant 
experimental photoluminescence properties of 1 at cryogenic and room temperatures (RT) are 
collected in Table 1. Experimentally, this blue emitter undergoes a significant drop of efficiency 
and lifetime at 298 K. As corroborated both experimentally10 and theoretically,18 this is due to the 
population of the thermally activated nonradiative decay process, which is readily accessible for 
1 at RT as a result of its reduced 𝐸6 value. Figure 1a (1b) displays the recorded (computed) plot 
of the global decay lifetime versus temperature and the computed decay components at different 
temperatures are presented in Table 2. An overall qualitative and quantitative agreement of the 
experimental decay lifetime is recovered by the calculations. Importantly, the sigmoid-like 
dependence is recovered by the computed profile. In the following we will study in detail the 
origins of the lifetime’s drop with increasing temperatures. In these plots, two distinct regimes 
are observed, a slight lifetime decrease at low temperatures and a second more significant drop at 
RT due to activation of the knr(T) decay channel. Hence, two important inflexion points are 
observable, which are computed at ca. 220 K and 320 K, and experimentally observed at 250 K 
and 340 K. A deeper analysis of the results (see Table 2) reveals that before the first inflexion

point, in the low-temperature regime (100-200 K), only the kr and kISC components contribute to 
the global lifetime (see Table 2). Due to the large 3MLCT→S0 SOCs, kr are of the order of 105. 
Regarding the kISC values, they are notably influenced by the 3MLCT-S0 energy gap and by the 
total reorganization energies. The total reorganization energy, which is a measure of the extent of 
vibronic coupling between these two electronic states, it is obtained as a sum over all normal 
mode energies times their corresponding Huang-Rhys factor. Figure 2 collects the reorganization 
energies of the most relevant normal modes. The normal modes in the 500-1600 cm-1 region 
predominantly contribute to the kISC value of 1 (see the displacement vectors of its three most 
relevant modes in Figure 2, which involve aromatic C=C stretchings and in-plane deformations 
of mainly the (F2ppy) ligand). As the relevant vibrational modes are of high frequency, there is 
only a slight increase of kISC with temperature (see Table 1). Finally, knr(T) originates from the 
thermally-activated formation of the 3MC state through the rupture of one Ir-N coordinating bond 
(see discussion above). In order to perform the CVT dynamics, the relevant stationary points of 
the 
rate 
limiting 
step, i.e., 
3MLCTàTSà3MC, were optimized and subsequently intrinsic 
reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried out in both forward and backward directions 
(B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ). In Figure 3 the corresponding IRC including selected 
geometries along the path are plotted. The 3MLCTàTSà3MC path is characterized by two main 
reaction coordinates: Ir-N bond stretching (from 2.18 to 3.43 Å) and an increase in the φ1,2,3,4 
dihedral angle (from 3 to 60° see Figure 3). Herein, one critical aspect that needs to be mastered 
for the CVT simulations is the accurate estimation of Ea; since, due to their exponential 
relationship, small deviations in the energies imply huge changes in the decay rates (see Eq. (6)). 
Towards this end, and based on previous studies on the activation energies of 5d transition metal 
complexes,25 the double-hybrid functional including dispersion PWPB95-D3 is chosen herein.

The results of the CVT simulations are collected in Table 3. For 1, the computed activation 
barrier of the limiting step (3MLCTà3MC) is 2836 cm-1. Experimentally, a Boltzmann analysis 
of the temperature-dependent photoluminescent decay data was performed and the activation 
barrier was determined to be 3300 cm-1. 10  To illustrate the problematic in the accuracy needed 
for the rate calculations, the activation barrier was determined to be ca. 1097 cm-1 with the 
B3LYP functional,18 clearly underestimating the PWPB95-D3 value and the experimental 
evidences. The exponential prefactor A obtained with the CVT simulations is 1.47×1013 s-1. The 
Eb-c values as well as the Boltzmann A0 prefactors at relevant temperatures are listed in Table S1. 
The knr(T) values computed at different temperatures with Eq. (6) are collected in Table 2. 
Coming back to the temperature-dependent photoluminescence decay of 1, the slight lifetime 
decrease in the 100-200 K regime can be understood as resulting from i) the increasing thermal 
population of the triplet substate with the largest kr value among the three substates of 3MLCT 
(see the three spin sublevel contributions in Table S2) and ii) the slight increase of kISC with 
increasing temperatures. In this temperature regime, the computed photoluminescence efficiency 
achieves a maximum value at 196 K (i.e., 0.38, see Table 2). Importantly, the knr(T) decay 
channel becomes only accessible at temperatures above ca. 230 K (see Table 2 and Figure 1). At 
RT it becomes the main nonradiative channel and directly competes with radiative decay. 
Finally, with increasing temperatures (up to 400 K) knr(T) evolves into the most prominent 
deactivation channel (see Table 2) and it is thus responsible for the total quench of the 
photoluminescence at high temperatures. The relevance of the knr(T) channel is further illustrated 
in Figure 1b. Hence, by switching off the contribution of the knr(T) component to Eq. (2) (dashed 
line in Figure 1b), the sigmoid-like temperature-dependence is lost. Regarding the efficiencies, 
our calculations predict a photoluminescence efficiency of 0.38 and 0.05 at low temperatures and

RT temperatures; respectively, in agreement with the experimentally observed drop in 
efficiencies. The theoretical ΦP value at RT of 1 is underestimated with respect to the 
experimental one, likely due to the computational inaccuracies on the rate calculations (see 
exemplarily the discussion above regarding the energetic inaccuracies and their exponential 
relationship in the knr(T) calculations).

Green-emitter case [fac-Ir(ppy)3 (2)]: Complex 2 has been extensively studied from both

In Table S3 are collected the computed kr, kISC and knr(T) decay rates at different temperatures for 
2, whereas the computed plot of the global decay lifetime versus temperature can be found in 
Figure 4. In this plot two inflexion points are observable, at ca. 280 K and 370 K. In the first

15
temperature regime (100-280 K) there is only direct competition between the kr and kISC 
components, since the computed knr(T) values are negligible (see Table S3).  The kr values are of 
the same order than those reported in previous works.15,22 The kISC decay is mainly promoted by 
C=C stretching vibration modes and in-plane bending deformations, which are predominantly 
localized on a single ppy ligand17 (see in Fig S1 the reorganization energies of the most relevant 
normal modes for 2). The IRC of its rate-limiting step, i.e., 3MLCTàTSà3MC, is shown in 
Figure S2. The main geometrical changes along this path are analogous to those of 1. The 
computed Ea value is 3676 cm-1 (see Table 3) and the prefactor A determined by the CVT 
dynamics is 1.7×1013 s-1. The Eb-c values and the Boltzmann A0 factors at relevant temperatures 
are listed in Table S1. Note that the computed barrier for 2 is, in agreement with the experiments, 
larger than that of 1. The knr(T) component starts to be non-negligible only beyond RT (compare 
the dash and bold computed profiles in Figure 4), and therefore, experimentally, 2 is still highly 
efficient at RT (ΦP=0.97). This is also corroborated by our calculations, which yield a value of 
0.72 at RT. This value is quite close to the maximum ΦP value in the low-temperature regime 
i.e., 0.80 at 196 K (see Table 1). Thus, the activation barrier to populate the 3MC channel is large 
enough to prevent its population in the 100-280 K regime. Conversely, the A value is of the same 
order for both complexes. Thus, the larger Ea value for 2 is the main feature that prevents the 
population of the knr(T) decay channel up to ambient temperatures and hence ensures its large ΦP 
value. Above 300 K, the radiative efficiency of complex 2 decreases significantly (see Table S3).

Yellow/Orange-emitter case [fac-Ir(flpy)3 (3)]: Due to their reduced T1-S0 energy gap; 
yellow, orange and red Ir(III) complexes are, in this increasing order, more prone to T1→S0 
nonradiative decay than green and blue ones. Conversely, this trend is reversed for the knr(T) 
component, since a more energetically stabilized T1 state generally leads to a larger Ea value that 
prevent the population of the 3MC state for the former complexes. The yellow/orange complex 3 
was studied in detail from an experimental point of view by Tsuboyama and coworkers.20 
Relevant experimental and computed photoluminescence data of 3 at cryogenic and room 
temperatures (RT) are collected in Table 1. In Table S4 the computed kr, kISC and knr(T) decay 
rates at different temperatures are listed, whilst the plot of the computed global decay lifetime 
versus temperature is found in Figure 5. The IRC of its 3MLCTàTSà3MC pathway is shown in 
Figure S4 and it shows identic geometrical distortions to those of 1-2. Finally, the computed Ea 
and A values are collected in Table 3 whilst the Eb-c and A0 values are reported in Table S1.

Complex 3 possesses the largest Ea value among all the studied complexes (5182 cm-1), thus 
confirming the initial hypothesis of diminished relevance of the knr(T) component for yellow-to-
red complexes. Indeed, the computed knr(T) values are negligible in all temperature regimes (77-
400 K), see Table S4; and thus the effect of switching off this component has a negligible effect 
(see in Figure 5). Therefore, the photoluminescence lifetimes of 3 are only determined by a 
direct competition between the kr and kISC components. The computed kr value (2.5×105) shows a 
perfect agreement with its experimental counterpart (see Table 1). The kISC is promoted by 
similar aromatic modes of those of 1-2, but conversely mainly localized on two ligands (see 
reorganization energies and the most relevant modes in Figure S3). Note that this complex is 
characterized by the smallest total reorganization energies amongst all the complexes. The 
agreement between the experimental and computed ΦP value is remarkable (see Table 1). 
Overall, and despite the negligible knr(T) contribution, smaller ΦP values are obtained for 3 with 
respect to 1-2. This trend is observed both computationally and experimentally and it is due to 
the confluence of two factors, a smaller kr value and an enhanced kISC value for 3. The smaller kr 
value can be rationalized in terms of the more pronounced ligand-centered (3LC) character of T1, 
that leads to smaller SOCs and ZFS values (compare the ΔE splitting between triplet sublevels 
for all complexes in Table S2). The enhanced 3LC character for 3 is corroborated by the small 
contribution of the iridium atom to the spin density distribution at the T1 (see Figure S7). 
Additionally, and despite the small total reorganization energies for 3, its reduced T1-S0 energy 
gap leads to an enhanced kISC decay rate as compared to 1-2. Therefore, these observations are in 
accordance to the energy-gap law.

Methods 
All the molecular parameters needed in our model are calculated by density functional theory 
(DFT). The geometries of the singlet ground state (S0), the 3MC and 3MLCT triplet excited states, 
and the transition state (TS) were optimized for complexes 1-3 using the hybrid functional 
B3LYP, in combination with the 6 31G(d,p) atomic basis set for all first and second-row atoms. 
Relativistic effects were included for the Ir atom by using the LANL2DZ pseudopotential. The 
nature of the stationary points was confirmed by computing the Hessian at the same level of 
theory. In the case of complex 3, the two methyl positions of the 9H-fluoren-2-yl)pyridine unit 
were replaced by hydrogen atoms for computational ease. The spin density distributions at the 
3MLCT, 3MC and TS optimized geometries of 1-3 are depicted in Figures S3-5. The S0/3MC 
MECP was optimized using Harvey's algorithm, as implemented in the ORCA software;27

employing the B3LYP functional in combination with the def2-SVP atomic basis set and the 
ECP-60-mwb Stuttgart/Dresden pseudopotential for Ir. To get accurate energies of Ea, single 
point calculations were performed with the dispersion-corrected double-hybrid PWPB95-D3 
functional,28 in combination with the def2-SVP atomic  basis and the ECP-60-mwb 
Stuttgart/Dresden pseudopotential for Ir, as implemented in ORCA. All calculations apart from 
the MECP optimization and the double-hybrid calculations, were carried out with the 
Gaussian09 program package.29 The effect of solvation on the geometries and on the computed 
activation barriers was assessed using THF as a solvent and the polarizable continuum model 
(PCM)30 as implemented in Gaussian. These results are presented in Table S5 for 1. In view of 
the small differences observed, the gas phase results were used in all the calculations for all 
complexes.  
To model the knr(T) decay channel, CVT dynamics were performed. Towards this end, intrinsic 
reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations of the rate limiting step, i.e., 3MLCTàTSà3MC, were 
carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level. Each point along the IRC path was used 
to build a reliable 3MLCTàTSà3MC potential energy surface (PES). The CVT dynamics were 
done with the POLYRATE suite of programs.31  
The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) was treated as a perturbation and the exact two-component (X2C) 
Hamiltonian was applied to construct the SOC operator. For the kr and kISC calculations, the SOC 
calculations were carried out at optimized S0 geometry with the BDF program package32 using 
TD-B3LYP in combination with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for light atoms and the ANO-RCC-
VDZP basis set for iridium atom.

where subscript i denotes the spin sublevel along with its oscillator strength (fi) and vertical

where 𝐸II,I = 𝐸vert,II −𝐸vert,I and 𝐸III,I = 𝐸vert,III −𝐸vert,I are the energy difference between spin 
sublevels. This thermal rearrangement between the triplet sublevels of 3MLCT originates the 
temperature-dependency of the kr values at cryogenic temperatures. 
For Ir(III) complexes, which are characterized by large SOCs, first-order perturbation theory is a 
good approximation to compute the nonradiave (kISC) rate. The kISC is evaluated using the TVCF 
theory. Perturbation theory was also applied to compute the non-adiabatic electronic coupling 
and the spin-orbit couplings. The TVCF formalism makes use of a multidimensional harmonic 
oscillator model coupled with DFT and TD-DFT calculations, where distortions, displacements 
and Duschinsky rotations are taken into account. Thus, the difference between two electronic 
state potential energy surfaces was considered by using Qe = S Qg+De, where S is the 
Duschinsky rotation matrix, Qe and Qg are the normal-mode coordinates vectors of the S0 and T1 
states, respectively; and De is the displacement vector between the minima of the excited and 
ground state geometries. Further details can be found in Ref. 17. The three key parameters

governing the kISC values are: i) the adiabatic energy gap, ii) the total reorganization energy and 
iii) the size of SOCs. The kISC rate calculations were performed with the MOMAP suite of

Conclusions 
The calculation of the temperature-dependent photoluminescent properties of phosphors has 
remained up to date elusive. In this manuscript, we report for the first time a general approach to 
compute the temperature-dependent photoluminescence lifetimes and efficiencies of Ir(III) 
complexes. Since all possible kinetic scenarios are included within our approach, its validity is 
not restrained for a limited series of complexes (like previous schemes), but it remains valid for a 
wide chemical space, i.e., from deep-blue to yellow-to-red phosphors. Importantly, the 
photoluminescence lifetimes and efficiencies can be estimated at any given temperature and the 
temperature-dependent photoluminescence decay profiles can be derived. Our future work 
should be devoted to further improve the efficiencies’ estimations in a quantitative basis, which 
it remains difficult due to the computational inaccuracies on the energetics and their exponential 
relationships in the rate calculations.  
Herein, we demonstrate that the strongly-temperature dependent knr(T) channel is non-
negligible up to green complexes. Accordingly, this channel is increasingly less relevant for 
yellow, orange and red complexes. In the case of blue complexes, controlling the knr(T) channel 
is mandatory to attain large photoluminescence efficiencies at RT. This can be accomplished via 
stronger Ir-heteroatom bonds that lead to larger Ea values, such as e.g., in N-Heterocyclic 
Carbene (NHC)-based Ir(III) complexes. For future blue phosphor materials design, and in view 
of the computed evidences, an Ea of ca. 4000 cm-1 might be enough to impede the population of

the knr(T) channel at RT. Additionally, this strategy is also beneficial to attain photostable blue  
Ir(III) emitters.38 Due to the enormous industrial efforts in obtaining highly-efficient phosphors 
and the increased use of high-throughput approaches on computational materials’ design, we 
anticipate that this protocol will be of great importance for the automatic in silico prescreening of 
promising PhOLEDs materials.
