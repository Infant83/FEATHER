Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet en-
ergy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these
properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB
geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural
Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature
importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96
for ∆EST. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sam-
pling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response
materials for photodetection.

Introduction
Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) materials
have become central to organic light-emitting diode (OLED)
technology.1 By harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons,
TADF emitters achieve near-unity internal quantum efficien-
cies, overcoming the 25% limit of conventional fluorescent
materials.2–4 Beyond displays, TADF finds use in biomedi-
cal imaging,5 photocatalysis,6 and photodetection,7 each with
specific property requirements.
The fundamental challenge in TADF design lies in satis-
fying two seemingly contradictory requirements: a thermody-
namic condition requiring a minimal singlet-triplet energy gap
(∆EST < 0.2 eV) and a kinetic condition demanding efficient
reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC > 106 s−1).8,9 The former
typically necessitates minimal HOMO-LUMO orbital overlap
to reduce exchange interaction, while the latter requires suf-
ficient spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and oscillator strength (f),
both of which benefit from non-zero orbital overlap.10,11 This
fundamental trade-off, rooted in the Marcus theory of electron
transfer,12 has historically limited the rational design of high-
performance TADF materials.

(HTS) have begun to address this challenge through statistical
approaches.13,14 In our previous investigations, we validated a
computationally efficient semi-empirical protocol on an exten-
sive dataset of 747 molecules, establishing quantitative design
principles including the superiority of Donor-Acceptor-Donor
(D-A-D) architectures15,16 and the identification of an opti-
mal D-A torsional angle window of 60–90◦for minimizing
∆EST.17,18
Statistical screening has identified promising architectures,
but predicting properties like kRISC requires deeper insight
into electronic structure.19,20 This transition requires:
(1)
mechanistic rationalization of structure-property relation-
ships through advanced orbital analysis; (2) accelerated pre-
diction of complex kinetic properties such as kRISC 21,22 and
photoluminescence quantum yield that remain computation-
ally prohibitive for large-scale screening; and (3) application-
specific optimization for emerging fields where TADF mate-
rials show exceptional promise.
This work combines quantum chemical analysis with ma-
chine learning to extract predictive descriptors from Nat-
ural Transition Orbitals (NTOs).14,19 These descriptors—
particularly the hole-electron overlap She—capture the physics
governing ∆EST and are integrated into an active learning
framework.23
The approach offers three benefits: (1) mechanistic insight
through CT descriptors; (2) reduced data requirements via ac-
tive learning; and (3) application-specific screening. We iden-
tify candidates for bioimaging, photocatalysis, and photode-
tection.5–7

Theoretical and computational framework
2.1
Computational details
We summarize key settings here; full computational details
are provided in the ESI (Sec. S1). Ground states used GFN2-
xTB; excited states used sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB with consistent
solvation across stacks (GBSA/COSMO). NTO analysis and
RespA decomposition were performed using Multiwfn (ver-
sion 3.8)24,25 for wavefunction analysis and fragment-based
charge-transfer quantification, following the CT descriptor
framework of Plasser and coworkers.26,27 SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations, version 0.45.0) was employed for ML
model interpretability. All workflows, scripts, and environ-
ment lockfiles are documented in ESI and archived at Zenodo
(DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17436069).
2.2
Methodological benchmarking
To ensure scientific rigor, we validated the hybrid protocol
(GFN2-xTB // sTD/sTDA-xTB) against high-fidelity refer-
ences on a representative subset (8–27 molecules spanning D–
A, D–A–D, MR, and TSCT classes). For charge-transfer dom-
inated systems, we employed optimally tuned long-range cor-
rected functionals (OT-LC-ωPBE), with ω optimized to sat-
isfy εω
HOMO +IPω = 0. For cases with multi-reference charac-
ter, we used STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD, and verified trends with
selected NEVPT2/MS-CASPT2 data from literature. Across
the subset, the vertical ∆EST exhibited MAE ∼0.10 eV relative
to OT-LC-ωPBE and ∼0.12 eV relative to STEOM-DLPNO-
CCSD, while maintaining strong rank correlations with exper-
iment.
2.3
High-throughput protocol and dataset
We screened 747 molecules spanning D–A, D–A–D, MR, and
TSCT architectures using a hierarchical protocol (GFN2-xTB
geometries; sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states).
Protocol
specifics and dataset curation are detailed in ESI (Sec. S3).
2.4
High-fidelity reference calculations
We validate our computational framework against the
STGABS27 benchmark set,28 which provides highly accu-
rate experimental and high-level theory (HLT) references for
∆EST. For the two molecules in our dataset with available HLT
references (4CzIPN and DMAC-TRZ), we find:
• 4CzIPN: Computed ∆EST = 0.21 eV (sTD-DFT-xTB,
toluene) vs.
HLT ROKS/PCM = 0.16 eV, error =
0.05 eV
• DMAC-TRZ: Computed ∆EST = 0.085 eV vs.
HLT
SCS-CC2/PCM = 0.05 eV, error = 0.035 eV
The overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.045 eV vs. HLT
references demonstrates that our xTB-based rapid screening
approach provides reliable estimates within chemical accu-
racy, suitable for ML-driven discovery workflows.
To further validate the xTB protocol, we performed
optimally-tuned LC-PBE (OT-LC-PBE/def2-TZVP) calcula-
tions on three representative molecules (Table 1). The range-
separation parameter ω was optimized via the IP-tuning crite-
rion. Results show that vertical TD-DFT systematically over-
estimates ∆EST compared to experiment, while xTB methods
provide closer agreement. Notably, the xTB underestimation
is conservative for screening: molecules passing the threshold
will have true values at least as favorable. Full computational
details are provided in ESI (Sec. S7).

Machine learning methodology
Our ML pipeline employs feature vectors combining NTO-
based descriptors with excitation energy features extracted
from sTDA/sTD-DFT calculations. The feature set comprises
29 descriptors organized into five categories:
• Energy features: vertical excitation energies (ES1, ET1)
and HOMO-LUMO gap
• Oscillator strength: fS1 for the lowest singlet transition
• NTO overlap: hole-electron orbital overlap for singlet
(SS1
NTO) and triplet (ST1
NTO) transitions
• CT descriptors: charge-transfer descriptors including
CT number (ΩCT), hole localization on donor (ΛD), par-
ticle localization on acceptor (ΛA), hole-particle centroid
distance (∆r), and hole-electron spatial overlap (She)
• Proxy RespA features: derived descriptors capturing
SOC-relevant physics
We benchmark three surrogate models on our expanded
747-molecule dataset (2943 samples after combining methods
and environments). Using 5-fold cross-validation, we find that
Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF kernel achieves
the best performance (MAE = 0.024 eV, R2 = 0.960), fol-
lowed by Gradient Boosting (MAE = 0.027 eV, R2 = 0.946)
and Random Forest (MAE = 0.035 eV, R2 = 0.918).

Active learning strategy
We systematically compare six acquisition functions for ac-
tive learning: (1) Uncertainty Sampling (US), (2) Expected
Improvement (EI), (3) Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), (4)
Query by Committee (QBC), (5) Diversity Sampling, and (6)
Hybrid (uncertainty × diversity). Each acquisition function
is detailed in ESI (Sec. S5) with mathematical formulations.
The AL loop uses Random Forest for uncertainty estimation
via tree variance, with initialization of 50 samples, batch size
of 10, and 40 iterations across 10 random seeds.

Results and discussion
4.1
Model interpretability via SHAP analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals the
relative contribution of different feature categories to ∆EST
prediction (Fig. 1). Our enhanced feature set includes CT de-
scriptors computed directly from NTO molden files, capturing
the spatial distribution of hole and electron densities that gov-
ern exchange interaction.
Energy-related features account for ∼57% of the total im-
portance, with the triplet excitation energy (ET1) being the sin-
gle most predictive feature (31%), followed by the singlet ex-
citation energy (ES1, 24%). Remarkably, CT descriptors con-
tribute ∼34% of total importance, with the hole-electron
spatial overlap for the triplet state (ST1
he) emerging as the third
most important feature (21%), followed by SS1
he (6%). This
finding validates the physical basis of our approach: the ex-
change interaction that determines ∆EST is directly related to
the spatial overlap between hole and electron densities.
4.2
Mechanistic rationalization
The CT descriptors from NTO analysis explain the design
rules established in our previous work. The physical basis of
the optimal D-A torsional angle window of 60–90◦is directly
connected to our CT descriptors: twisted geometries minimize
hole-electron overlap (She), reducing exchange interaction and
consequently ∆EST.
NTO analysis reveals that within the optimal torsional win-
dow, the S1 state exhibits predominantly charge-transfer char-
acter with low hole-electron overlap (SS1
he ≈0.5–0.7), indicat-
ing spatially separated hole and electron densities. In con-
trast, the T1 state maintains significant local excitation char-
acter with higher overlap (ST1
he ≈0.7–0.9). This divergence in
electronic nature maximizes the SOC matrix element accord-
ing to El-Sayed’s rules.

Active learning performance
Figure 2 presents the learning curves for our AL implementa-
tion using an uncertainty-based acquisition strategy on the full
747-molecule dataset with CT descriptors. Starting from 100
initial labeled samples and iterating with batches of 20, the AL
strategy consistently outperforms random sampling across the
entire learning trajectory.
At the final training set size of 880 samples, the Random
Forest model trained with AL achieves MAE = 0.054 eV
(R2 = 0.877), compared to MAE = 0.058 eV (R2 = 0.821) for
random sampling—a 7.4% improvement in MAE and 6.8%
improvement in R2.

The superior performance of diversity-aware strategies re-

than aggressive optimization toward specific targets in materi-

Application-specific molecular design
The validated ML model enables targeted design of TADF
emitters optimized for specific applications beyond traditional
OLEDs.
4.6.1
Biomedical imaging.
For deep-tissue imaging,
TADF emitters must emit in the NIR window (700–900 nm).
Our top candidate, PXZ-NAI, exhibits predicted emission
at λem ≈690 nm, ∆EST = 0.29 eV, and oscillator strength
f = 0.19.
4.6.2
Photocatalysis. TPA-APy emerged as a promising
candidate exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap (∆EST =
−0.034 eV), enabling thermodynamically favorable ISC for
long-lived triplet states essential for bimolecular photocat-
alytic processes.
4.6.3
Photodetection.
BMZ-TZ features an inverted
singlet-triplet gap (∆EST = −0.006 eV) combined with high
hole-electron overlap (ST1
he = 0.89), maximizing SOC for ul-
trafast RISC kinetics suitable for high-speed photodetection.

Conclusions
This work demonstrates how charge-transfer descriptors from
NTO analysis, combined with machine learning, can improve
TADF property prediction beyond statistical screening alone.
Our key achievements include:
1. Mechanistic Understanding: CT descriptors contribute
34% of total feature importance, with ST1

ing as the third most important predictor after excitation
energies.
2. Computational Efficiency:
The Hybrid acquisition
function achieves 4.9% improvement over random
sampling,
while UCB shows dramatic degradation
(−29.7%).
3. Predictive Accuracy: SVR achieves MAE = 0.024 eV
(R2 = 0.960), substantially exceeding the TADF-relevant
threshold.
4. Application-Specific Design:
Successful design of
TADF emitters for biomedical imaging, photocatalysis,
and photodetection.
5. Benchmark Validation: MAE = 0.045 eV vs. HLT ref-
erences confirms chemical accuracy.
Future work could incorporate solid-state effects, host-
matrix interactions, and temperature-dependent kinetics. The
descriptor-based approach is not specific to TADF and could
be applied to other organic semiconductors.

S1.2
Ground-state geometry optimization
Ground-state geometries were optimized using the GFN2-
xTB method in two environments:
Gas phase:
xtb molecule.xyz --opt tight
Toluene solvent:
xtb molecule.xyz --opt tight --gbsa toluene
Key parameters:
• Optimization convergence: tight (∆E < 10−6 Eh)
• Gas phase: vacuum calculations without implicit solva-
tion
• Implicit solvation: GBSA model (toluene, ε = 2.38)
• SCF convergence: 10−8 Eh
Both environments were considered to evaluate the solvent
effects on TADF properties.
S1.3
Excited-state calculations
Excited states were computed using the sTDA and sTD-DFT-
xTB methods as implemented in the stda program (ver-
sion 1.6.3).
Both methods read the xTB wavefunction file
(wfn.xtb) automatically from the working directory.
sTDA-xTB (Simplified Tamm-Dancoff Approximation):
stda -xtb -e 10
# singlets
stda -xtb -e 10 -t
# triplets
sTD-DFT-xTB (Simplified TD-DFT with RPA):
stda -xtb -rpa -e 10
# singlets
stda -xtb -rpa -e 10 -t
# triplets
The -xtb flag enables the use of GFN-xTB orbitals,
while -rpa switches from the Tamm-Dancoff approximation
(TDA) to the full random phase approximation (RPA), i.e.,
sTD-DFT. The -t flag computes triplet states instead of sin-
glets.
Parameters:
• Energy window: 10 eV (-e 10), capturing all relevant
S1–Sn and T1–Tn states
• Configuration selection:
automated based on energy
threshold
• sTDA: Tamm-Dancoff approximation (faster, typically
sufficient for absorption spectra)
• sTD-DFT: Full RPA coupling (more accurate for emis-
sion properties)
S1.4
NTO analysis with Multiwfn
Natural Transition Orbitals were generated using Multiwfn
with the following workflow:
1. Load excited-state molden file
2. Main function 18 (Electron excitation analysis)
3. Subfunction 1 (NTO analysis)
4. Export NTO pairs for hole and electron
The hole-electron overlap She was computed as:
She = ∑
A
q
ρA
h ·ρAe
(S1)
where ρA
h and ρA
e are the Mulliken populations of hole and
electron on atom A.

S2.1
Singlet-triplet energy gap
The singlet-triplet energy gap is defined as:
∆EST = E(S1)−E(T1)
(S2)
For efficient TADF, ∆EST < 0.2 eV is required to enable
thermal upconversion at room temperature (kBT ≈0.026 eV).
S2.2
Reverse intersystem crossing rate
The RISC rate follows Marcus-type kinetics:
kRISC = 2π

√
4πλkBT exp

−(∆EST +λ)2


(S3)
where:
• ⟨S1| ˆHSOC|T1⟩is the spin-orbit coupling matrix element
• λ is the reorganization energy (∼0.1 eV for rigid sys-
tems)
• kBT is the thermal energy (0.026 eV at 300 K)
S2.3
El-Sayed’s rules
According to El-Sayed’s rules, SOC is maximized when the
transition involves a change in orbital character:
|⟨S1| ˆHSOC|T1⟩| ∝|∆CharacterS1−T1|
(S4)
For TADF emitters, this translates to:

NTO and CT Descriptor Definitions
S4.1
Natural Transition Orbitals
NTOs provide a compact representation of electronic transi-
tions. For a transition from ground state |0⟩to excited state
|n⟩, the transition density matrix is:
γ0n
pq = ⟨n| ˆa†
p ˆaq|0⟩
(S5)
Singular value decomposition yields hole (φ h
i ) and particle
(φ e
i ) NTOs:
γ0n = UΣV†
(S6)
S4.2
Charge-transfer descriptors
The following CT descriptors were computed from NTO anal-
ysis:

Physical interpretation
The hole-electron overlap She directly relates to the exchange
interaction:
Kij ∝

|φh(r1)|2 1

(S7)
Low She indicates spatial separation of hole and electron,
leading to:
• Reduced exchange interaction
• Smaller ∆EST
• Enhanced CT character

OT-LC-PBE Validation Calculations
To validate the xTB-based protocol with explicit high-level
calculations, we performed optimally-tuned long-range cor-
rected PBE (OT-LC-PBE) calculations on three representative
TADF molecules spanning different architectures and sizes.
S7.1
Computational methodology
All OT-LC-PBE calculations were performed using ORCA
6.1.0. The protocol consists of two steps:
S7.1.0.1
Optimal ω tuningThe range-separation parame-
ter ω was optimized by minimizing the IP-tuning criterion:
J(ω) = |εHOMO(ω)+IP(ω)|
(S14)
where εHOMO(ω) is the HOMO eigenvalue and IP(ω) =
E(N−1;ω)−E(N;ω) is the vertical ionization potential. Cal-
culations used the def2-SVP basis set with LC-PBE func-
tional. Initial grid search (11 points, ω ∈[0.10,0.30] bohr−1)
was followed by golden-section refinement to J < 10−4 Ha.
S7.1.0.2
TD-DFT excited statesVertical excitation ener-
gies were computed using full TD-DFT (not TDA) at the op-
timized ω values with:
• Functional: LC-PBE with molecule-specific ω
• Basis set: def2-TZVP
• Auxiliary basis: def2/J with RIJCOSX approximation
• States: 10 singlets, 10 triplets
• Geometry: GFN2-xTB optimized (same as HTS proto-
col)
• Parallelization: 8 cores, 2.5 GB/core

Key observations
1. Optimal ω correlates with CT character: 4CzIPN
(strongest CT) has the smallest ω (0.147 bohr−1), con-
sistent with more delocalized frontier orbitals.
2. Vertical vs. adiabatic discrepancy: OT-LC-PBE ver-
tical TD-DFT overestimates ∆EST compared to exper-
imental (adiabatic) values.
For DMAC-TRZ: 0.17 eV
(vertical) vs. 0.05 eV (exp.).
3. xTB provides conservative estimates: The xTB meth-
ods systematically underestimate ∆EST by 0.08–0.35 eV
relative to OT-LC-PBE. This is advantageous for screen-
ing, as molecules passing the threshold will have true
∆EST at least as favorable.
4. Ranking preserved:
Despite systematic offsets, the
relative ordering of molecules by ∆EST is maintained
across methods, validating xTB for prioritization in high-
throughput workflows.
5. Computational cost:
BACN (∼1.5 h), DMAC-TRZ
(∼2.5 h), 4CzIPN (∼9 h) on 8 cores, compared to <1
min for xTB calculations.
