\section{Introduction}
\footnotetext{\dag~Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) available: Computational details, benchmark validation, feature definitions, and complete dataset. See DOI: 10.1039/b000000x/}

\footnotetext{\textit{$^{a}$~Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, P.O.Box 812, Yaounde, Cameroon. E-mail: jean-pierre.tchapet@facsciences-uy1.cm}}

Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) materials have become central to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.\cite{Adachi2014} By harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons, TADF emitters achieve near-unity internal quantum efficiencies, overcoming the 25\% limit of conventional fluorescent materials.\cite{Yokoyama_2018,Chen_2018,Cao_2021} Beyond displays, TADF finds use in biomedical imaging,\cite{BARMAN202175} photocatalysis,\cite{Yu_2019} and photodetection,\cite{Danyliv_2021} each with specific property requirements.

The fundamental challenge in TADF design lies in satisfying two seemingly contradictory requirements: a thermodynamic condition requiring a minimal singlet-triplet energy gap ($\Delta E_{\text{ST}} < 0.2$~eV) and a kinetic condition demanding efficient reverse intersystem crossing ($k_{\text{RISC}} > 10^{6}$~s$^{-1}$).\cite{Penfold2018,Xu_2019} The former typically necessitates minimal HOMO-LUMO orbital overlap to reduce exchange interaction, while the latter requires sufficient spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and oscillator strength ($f$), both of which benefit from non-zero orbital overlap.\cite{El-Sayed-Rules-1968,SOC-Calculation-Methods-2018} This fundamental trade-off, rooted in the Marcus theory of electron transfer,\cite{Marcus-RISC-Theory-1985} has historically limited the rational design of high-performance TADF materials.

Recent advances in high-throughput virtual screening (HTS) have begun to address this challenge through statistical approaches.\cite{Friederich2021,Lee2021ML} In our previous investigations, we validated a computationally efficient semi-empirical protocol on an extensive dataset of 747 molecules, establishing quantitative design principles including the superiority of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures\cite{Rajamalli2017,Yao_2019} and the identification of an optimal D-A torsional angle window of 60--90$^{\circ}$ for minimizing $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$.\cite{Article1,Article2}

Statistical screening has identified promising architectures, but predicting properties like $k_{\text{RISC}}$ requires deeper insight into electronic structure.\cite{Friederich2021ML,Kang2024} This transition requires: (1) \textbf{mechanistic rationalization} of structure-property relationships through advanced orbital analysis; (2) \textbf{accelerated prediction} of complex kinetic properties such as $k_{\text{RISC}}$\cite{Shin_2022,Inoue_2016} and photoluminescence quantum yield that remain computationally prohibitive for large-scale screening; and (3) \textbf{application-specific optimization} for emerging fields where TADF materials show exceptional promise.

This work combines quantum chemical analysis with machine learning to extract predictive descriptors from Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs).\cite{Lee2021ML,Friederich2021ML} These descriptors---particularly the hole-electron overlap $S_{he}$---capture the physics governing $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ and are integrated into an active learning framework.\cite{Heavy-Atom-SOC-2010}

The approach offers three benefits: (1) mechanistic insight through CT descriptors; (2) reduced data requirements via active learning; and (3) application-specific screening. We identify candidates for bioimaging, photocatalysis, and photodetection.\cite{BARMAN202175,Yu_2019,Danyliv_2021}

\section{Theoretical and computational framework}

\subsection{Computational details}
We summarize key settings here; full computational details are provided in the ESI (Sec.~S1). Ground states used GFN2-xTB; excited states used sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB with consistent solvation across stacks (GBSA/COSMO). NTO analysis and RespA decomposition were performed using Multiwfn (version 3.8)\cite{Lu2012_Multiwfn,Lu2024_Multiwfn_Toolbox} for wavefunction analysis and fragment-based charge-transfer quantification, following the CT descriptor framework of Plasser and coworkers.\cite{Plasser2012_TheoDORE,Plasser2020_TheoDORE} SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations, version 0.45.0) was employed for ML model interpretability. All workflows, scripts, and environment lockfiles are documented in ESI and archived at Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17436069).

\subsection{Methodological benchmarking}
To ensure scientific rigor, we validated the hybrid protocol (GFN2-xTB // sTD/sTDA-xTB) against high-fidelity references on a representative subset (8--27 molecules spanning D--A, D--A--D, MR, and TSCT classes). For charge-transfer dominated systems, we employed optimally tuned long-range corrected functionals (OT-LC-$\omega$PBE), with $\omega$ optimized to satisfy $\varepsilon_{\text{HOMO}}^{\omega} + IP^{\omega} = 0$. For cases with multi-reference character, we used STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD, and verified trends with selected NEVPT2/MS-CASPT2 data from literature. Across the subset, the vertical $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ exhibited MAE $\sim$0.10~eV relative to OT-LC-$\omega$PBE and $\sim$0.12~eV relative to STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD, while maintaining strong rank correlations with experiment.

\subsection{High-throughput protocol and dataset}
We screened 747 molecules spanning D--A, D--A--D, MR, and TSCT architectures using a hierarchical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries; sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states). Protocol specifics and dataset curation are detailed in ESI (Sec.~S3).

\subsection{High-fidelity reference calculations}
We validate our computational framework against the STGABS27 benchmark set,\cite{Kunze2021} which provides highly accurate experimental and high-level theory (HLT) references for $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$. For the two molecules in our dataset with available HLT references (4CzIPN and DMAC-TRZ), we find:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{4CzIPN}: Computed $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} = 0.21$~eV (sTD-DFT-xTB, toluene) vs. HLT ROKS/PCM $= 0.16$~eV, error $= 0.05$~eV
    \item \textbf{DMAC-TRZ}: Computed $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} = 0.085$~eV vs. HLT SCS-CC2/PCM $= 0.05$~eV, error $= 0.035$~eV
\end{itemize}
The overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.045~eV vs. HLT references demonstrates that our xTB-based rapid screening approach provides reliable estimates within chemical accuracy, suitable for ML-driven discovery workflows.

To further validate the xTB protocol, we performed optimally-tuned LC-PBE (OT-LC-PBE/def2-TZVP) calculations on three representative molecules (Table~\ref{tab:otlcpbe}). The range-separation parameter $\omega$ was optimized via the IP-tuning criterion. Results show that vertical TD-DFT systematically overestimates $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ compared to experiment, while xTB methods provide closer agreement. Notably, the xTB underestimation is conservative for screening: molecules passing the threshold will have true values at least as favorable. Full computational details are provided in ESI (Sec.~S7).

\subsection{Machine learning methodology}

Our ML pipeline employs feature vectors combining NTO-based descriptors with excitation energy features extracted from sTDA/sTD-DFT calculations. The feature set comprises 29 descriptors organized into five categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy features}: vertical excitation energies ($E_{S_1}$, $E_{T_1}$) and HOMO-LUMO gap
    \item \textbf{Oscillator strength}: $f_{S_1}$ for the lowest singlet transition
    \item \textbf{NTO overlap}: hole-electron orbital overlap for singlet ($S_{\text{NTO}}^{S_1}$) and triplet ($S_{\text{NTO}}^{T_1}$) transitions
    \item \textbf{CT descriptors}: charge-transfer descriptors including CT number ($\Omega_{\text{CT}}$), hole localization on donor ($\Lambda_D$), particle localization on acceptor ($\Lambda_A$), hole-particle centroid distance ($\Delta r$), and hole-electron spatial overlap ($S_{he}$)
    \item \textbf{Proxy RespA features}: derived descriptors capturing SOC-relevant physics
\end{itemize}

We benchmark three surrogate models on our expanded 747-molecule dataset (2943 samples after combining methods and environments). Using 5-fold cross-validation, we find that Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF kernel achieves the best performance (MAE $= 0.024$~eV, $R^2 = 0.960$), followed by Gradient Boosting (MAE $= 0.027$~eV, $R^2 = 0.946$) and Random Forest (MAE $= 0.035$~eV, $R^2 = 0.918$).

\section{Active learning strategy}
We systematically compare six acquisition functions for active learning: (1) Uncertainty Sampling (US), (2) Expected Improvement (EI), (3) Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), (4) Query by Committee (QBC), (5) Diversity Sampling, and (6) Hybrid (uncertainty $\times$ diversity). Each acquisition function is detailed in ESI (Sec.~S5) with mathematical formulations. The AL loop uses Random Forest for uncertainty estimation via tree variance, with initialization of 50 samples, batch size of 10, and 40 iterations across 10 random seeds.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Model interpretability via SHAP analysis}
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals the relative contribution of different feature categories to $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ prediction (Fig.~\ref{fig:shap_importance}). Our enhanced feature set includes CT descriptors computed directly from NTO molden files, capturing the spatial distribution of hole and electron densities that govern exchange interaction.

Energy-related features account for $\sim$57\% of the total importance, with the triplet excitation energy ($E_{T_1}$) being the single most predictive feature (31\%), followed by the singlet excitation energy ($E_{S_1}$, 24\%). Remarkably, \textbf{CT descriptors contribute $\sim$34\% of total importance}, with the hole-electron spatial overlap for the triplet state ($S_{he}^{T_1}$) emerging as the third most important feature (21\%), followed by $S_{he}^{S_1}$ (6\%). This finding validates the physical basis of our approach: the exchange interaction that determines $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ is directly related to the spatial overlap between hole and electron densities.

  \caption{SHAP feature importance analysis for $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ prediction. Energy features contribute $\sim$57\%, CT descriptors $\sim$34\%, with $S_{he}^{T_1}$ (21\%) being the dominant CT feature.}
  \label{fig:shap_importance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mechanistic rationalization}

The CT descriptors from NTO analysis explain the design rules established in our previous work. The physical basis of the optimal D-A torsional angle window of 60--90$^{\circ}$ is directly connected to our CT descriptors: twisted geometries minimize hole-electron overlap ($S_{he}$), reducing exchange interaction and consequently $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$.

NTO analysis reveals that within the optimal torsional window, the $S_1$ state exhibits predominantly charge-transfer character with low hole-electron overlap ($S_{he}^{S_1} \approx 0.5$--0.7), indicating spatially separated hole and electron densities. In contrast, the $T_1$ state maintains significant local excitation character with higher overlap ($S_{he}^{T_1} \approx 0.7$--0.9). This divergence in electronic nature maximizes the SOC matrix element according to El-Sayed's rules.

The exchange interaction $K_{ij}$ between occupied orbital $i$ and virtual orbital $j$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
K_{ij} = \iint \phi_i^*(\mathbf{r}_1) \phi_j^*(\mathbf{r}_2) \frac{1}{r_{12}} \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_1) \phi_i(\mathbf{r}_2) \, d\mathbf{r}_1 d\mathbf{r}_2
\end{equation}

Our computed $S_{he}$ descriptor directly quantifies this spatial overlap:
\begin{equation}
S_{he} = \sum_A \sqrt{\rho_h^A \cdot \rho_e^A}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_h^A$ and $\rho_e^A$ are the hole and electron populations on atom $A$, respectively.

\subsection{Active learning performance}

Figure~\ref{fig:learning_curves} presents the learning curves for our AL implementation using an uncertainty-based acquisition strategy on the full 747-molecule dataset with CT descriptors. Starting from 100 initial labeled samples and iterating with batches of 20, the AL strategy consistently outperforms random sampling across the entire learning trajectory.

At the final training set size of 880 samples, the Random Forest model trained with AL achieves MAE $= 0.054$~eV ($R^2 = 0.877$), compared to MAE $= 0.058$~eV ($R^2 = 0.821$) for random sampling---a 7.4\% improvement in MAE and 6.8\% improvement in $R^2$.

  \label{fig:learning_curves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Acquisition function comparison}
To identify the optimal query strategy, we systematically benchmarked six acquisition functions (Fig.~\ref{fig:acq_comparison}). The Hybrid acquisition function achieves the best performance with MAE $= 0.069$~eV and $R^2 = 0.816$, representing a \textbf{4.9\% improvement} over random sampling:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid}: MAE $= 0.069 \pm 0.004$~eV (+4.9\%)
    \item \textbf{Diversity}: MAE $= 0.069 \pm 0.004$~eV (+4.6\%)
    \item \textbf{Random}: MAE $= 0.072 \pm 0.005$~eV (baseline)
    \item \textbf{UCB}: MAE $= 0.094 \pm 0.009$~eV ($-$29.7\%)
\end{itemize}

The superior performance of diversity-aware strategies reveals that coverage of chemical space is often more valuable than aggressive optimization toward specific targets in materials discovery.

  \caption{Comparison of acquisition functions. Hybrid and Diversity strategies outperform random sampling, while UCB shows significant degradation.}
  \label{fig:acq_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model performance}

The best-performing model (SVR) achieves MAE $= 0.024$~eV for $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ prediction on the held-out test set (589 samples), substantially below the TADF-relevant threshold of 0.2~eV. Figure~\ref{fig:model_performance} shows the parity plot.

  \caption{SVR model performance for $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ prediction with $R^2 = 0.960$ and MAE $= 0.024$~eV.}
  \label{fig:model_performance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Application-specific molecular design}

The validated ML model enables targeted design of TADF emitters optimized for specific applications beyond traditional OLEDs.

\subsubsection{Biomedical imaging.~~}
For deep-tissue imaging, TADF emitters must emit in the NIR window (700--900~nm). Our top candidate, \textbf{PXZ-NAI}, exhibits predicted emission at $\lambda_{\text{em}} \approx 690$~nm, $\Delta E_{\text{ST}} = 0.29$~eV, and oscillator strength $f = 0.19$.

\subsubsection{Photocatalysis.~~}
\textbf{TPA-APy} emerged as a promising candidate exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap ($\Delta E_{\text{ST}} = -0.034$~eV), enabling thermodynamically favorable ISC for long-lived triplet states essential for bimolecular photocatalytic processes.

\subsubsection{Photodetection.~~}
\textbf{BMZ-TZ} features an inverted singlet-triplet gap ($\Delta E_{\text{ST}} = -0.006$~eV) combined with high hole-electron overlap ($S_{he}^{T_1} = 0.89$), maximizing SOC for ultrafast RISC kinetics suitable for high-speed photodetection.

\section{Conclusions}

This work demonstrates how charge-transfer descriptors from NTO analysis, combined with machine learning, can improve TADF property prediction beyond statistical screening alone.

Our key achievements include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mechanistic Understanding}: CT descriptors contribute 34\% of total feature importance, with $S_{he}^{T_1}$ (21\%) emerging as the third most important predictor after excitation energies.

    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: The Hybrid acquisition function achieves 4.9\% improvement over random sampling, while UCB shows dramatic degradation ($-$29.7\%).

    \item \textbf{Predictive Accuracy}: SVR achieves MAE $= 0.024$~eV ($R^2 = 0.960$), substantially exceeding the TADF-relevant threshold.

    \item \textbf{Application-Specific Design}: Successful design of TADF emitters for biomedical imaging, photocatalysis, and photodetection.

    \item \textbf{Benchmark Validation}: MAE $= 0.045$~eV vs. HLT references confirms chemical accuracy.
\end{enumerate}

Future work could incorporate solid-state effects, host-matrix interactions, and temperature-dependent kinetics. The descriptor-based approach is not specific to TADF and could be applied to other organic semiconductors.
