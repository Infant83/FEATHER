Abstract. With the recently rapid development of flexible electronics, stretchable OLEDs has 
become a significant direction to study because of its strong potential, like its ultra-thin structure, 
self-emissive nature, bendability, and stretchability. This new technology not only overcomes the 
limitations of traditional rigid screens, but also provides new opportunities in developing other fields, 
for example healthcare and human-computer interaction. From this perspective, the existing 
technology of OLED and its applications in different fields deserve attention. Firstly, it introduces the 
laser programming Buckling Process, three different island-bridge structures, Fold Bridge and 
Curved Bridge, Serpentine Bridge and Fractal Bridge, and talks about the Intrinsically stretchable 
materials. It then gives a few examples of applications in different fields, including Heart rate and 
blood oxygen monitoring, Variable-size screens and wearable devices and Phototherapy. This article 
not only makes a conclusion of current technological achievements and challenges of stretchable 
OLEDs but also makes a foundation for the future development of this field. 
Keywords: Stretchable OLED; recent advance; wearable devices; phototherapy. 
1. Introduction 
Nowadays, the two major types of displays used in daily life are LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
displays and OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays. The LCD displays use Backlight Units 
as the light source, and their colors are controlled by the deflection of liquid crystals and RGB pixels. 
This makes their contrast weaker than that of OLED displays, and they cannot be stretched. In contrast, 
OLED displays are composed of small, individual light-emitting diodes made from organic 
compounds—these compounds emit light in response to an electric current. This enables OLED 
displays to show pure black simply by not applying an electric current to the diodes. Additionally, it 
eliminates the need for a backlight unit, simplifying its structure and resulting in a thinner profile that 
saves space and reduces power consumption. Without a backlight unit, OLED displays also produce 
softer light and enable stretchability [1]. Thus, this stretchable potential makes them highly demanded 
in wearable devices and the healthcare field. 
Wearable devices leverage stretchable OLED displays by shaping them into various forms, which 
enhances wearing comfort and increases the display area. What’s more, extensibility also allows these 
displays to be used in more scenarios—they no longer need a fixed shape and can even be designed 
as spheres or cylinders. Another advantage of OLED displays lies in their healthcare applications: 
their flexibility allows them to adhere more closely to the skin, enabling more accurate data collection 
and a more comfortable wearing experience [2]. This is particularly useful for pulse rate monitoring, 
pulse oximetry, and biosignal visualization. Additionally, stretchable OLEDs can also be applied in 
medical phototherapy. 
At the current research stage, there are mainly three solutions to achieve stretchability in OLED 
displays: (1) Laser-Programmed Buckling Process: A technique that uses laser patterning to allow 
OLEDs to bend locally, instead of stretching or compressing globally; (2) 3D Height-Alternating 
Island Structure: A special design where display components (arranged as &quot;islands&quot;) are placed at 
alternating heights and connected by stretchable materials; (3) Intrinsically Stretchable Materials: A 
method where all components of the OLED display are made from stretchable materials. 
This review summarizes the latest developments in stretchable OLEDs. The three main solutions 
for stretchable OLED are highlighted, describing how each solution achieves stretchability, its

advantages, as well as the main limitations and challenges currently faced [3]. In addition, the 
application of stretchable OLEDs will be studied, and the requirements of these applications will be 
compared with the capabilities of current technology. By delving into these aspects, detailed 
comparisons can be made between different technologies, and future prospects can be outlined by 
emphasizing the main challenges currently faced by researchers [4]. 
2. Overview of Stretchable OLED Background and Existing Technologies 
2.1. Laser Programming Buckling Process 
This solution was proposed by a research group from Jilin University in China [5]. In their study, 
they presented a technique for fabricating highly stretchable OLEDs that exhibit both high efficiency 
and mechanical durability. This OLED is manufactured via a laser-programmable buckling process, 
which enables the OLED to form an ordered buckling profile—this profile supports controlled 
stretch-and-release cycles. From their experimental data, they demonstrated that the device achieved 
a maximum efficiency of 72.5, 68.5, and 70.0 cd A⁻¹ at a mechanical strain of 0%, 40%, and 70%, 
respectively [5]. The OLEDs can withstand a tensile strain of up to 100% and exhibit only minor 
fluctuations in performance over 15,000 stretch-release cycles. In addition, this method also features 
ease of application and low cost, which makes it stand out among all existing solutions. The process 
is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 1 The process of Laser Programming Buckling [5] 
Researchers used femtosecond laser ablation to create a one-dimensional grating with a 570 μm 
period in the elastomeric layer (3M VHB 4905). They then used an ultra-thin OLED/polymer (~10 
μm thick) film in a “pre-stretch-attach-release” strategy to achieve ordered buckling—particularly on 
top of the grooves of the one-dimensional grating—rather than random wrinkling. These stretchable 
displays could be stretched up to 70% strain with a 120% pre-strain; by increasing the pre-strain to 
200%, a maximum stretch of 100% could be achieved [6]. Even when attached to a bending finger 
joint (experiencing ~55–60% strain), the devices’ buckles remained ordered, demonstrating great 
application value in wearable electronics. This is because the ordered layout of both electrodes 
ensured that the devices’ conductivity did not change significantly even under maximum strain.

Benefiting from the ultra-smooth polymer substrates (surface roughness: 0.35 nm), researchers 
deposited small-molecule materials via thermal evaporation—with the emissive layer using 
Ir(ppy)₃—and developed highly flexible OLEDs with efficiency exceeding all previously reported 
levels. Notably, after fabricating these OLEDs on elastomeric substrates, they could emit light even 
when stretched from 0–100%. At a driving voltage of 4 V, the Current Efficiency (CE) remained high 
across the entire stretch range: 72.5 cd/A at 0% strain, 68.5 cd/A at 40% strain, and 70 cd/A at 70% 
strain. This performance exceeded that of the reference planar device (fabricated on silicon wafers), 
which had a CE of ~71 cd/A (the same as the stretchable device at the corresponding strain). 
Importantly, the stretchable OLEDs’ performance was much higher than any reported data to date. 
Finally, in long-term tests, the devices showed excellent endurance: after over 15,000 stretch/release 
cycles in a 0–20% strain range, only ~16% luminance loss was observed; even in a higher-strain range 
(0–40%), only 25% luminance loss occurred after ~6,000 cycles. In fact, the current efficiency 
increased slightly, likely due to lower current density resulting from the ordered layout. 
This work showed that the maximum tensile strain of the devices could be precisely tuned by 
laser-programming both the groove width and line width of the gratings [7]. For a fixed line width 
(400 μm), the maximum strain increased with groove width. Controlling the grooves revealed that 
increasing the groove width reduced the buckling frequency and the area required for failure; however, 
the maximum strain of the structures decreased with increasing groove width and increased with 
increasing line width. For a fixed groove width (170 μm), the maximum strain decreased as the line 
width increased. Strain was mainly concentrated in the grooves, enabling “on-demand design” of the 
buckling behavior and ultimate stretching capability of the devices. 
To fabricate these OLEDs, a commercial femtosecond laser microfabrication system (wavelength: 
800 nm, pulse width: 100 fs, repetition rate: 1 kHz) was used to create one-dimensional grating 
structures on the surface of 3M VHB 4905 elastomeric substrates. A laser fluence of 6,000 W/cm2 
was selected, and different scanning paths were used to create regular 4 × 4 cm2 groove arrays with 
a 570 μm period. The key effect of the laser process was removing surface adhesion in the groove 
regions without affecting the high surface adhesion in the grating line regions (90° peel strength: 21 
N/cm) [8]. This enabled subsequent selective adhesion of the devices. 
Next, a 10 μm flexible thin-film device was fabricated by spin-coating photosensitive NOA43 
onto an ultra-smooth silicon wafer (surface roughness: 0.35 nm) followed by UV curing. The 
functional layer stack—Ag anode (80 nm)/MoO₃ hole injection layer (3 nm)/NPB hole transport layer 
(40 nm)/mCP:Ir(ppy)3 (6%, 20 nm) emissive layer/TPBi electron transport layer (35 nm)/Ca/Ag 
cathode (3/18 nm)—was then deposited via thermal evaporation. The fully completed functional stack 
could be freely delaminated from the rigid silicon substrate to form free-standing ultrathin light-
emitting OLED films. 
Second, the patterned elastomeric substrates were pre-stretched to 120–200% strain using a 
precision stretching stage, causing the grating period to increase accordingly. The prepared ultrathin 
OLED devices were then transferred onto the surface of the stretched elastomeric substrates. Using 
the difference in adhesion between the substrates and devices, the devices bonded to the grating line 
regions but remained suspended over the groove regions. When the initial pre-strain was released, the 
elastomeric substrates experienced compressive strain, resulting in ordered buckling and forming a 
three-dimensional wavy morphology of the light-emitting regions (suspended in the grooves). 
Deformable eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid metal connections were used to maintain stable 
electrical transmission while the devices were stretched [9]. EGaIn is a eutectic mixture of gallium 
and indium with good stretchability, low resistivity (29.4 × 10-6 Ω·cm), and low toxicity—making it 
safe for use as a connecting electrode in stretchable and wearable electronics. 
2.2. Island-Bridge Structure 
In the island-bridge structure, for non-stretchable sensor components, the luminescent parts are 
regarded as &quot;islands&quot;. These islands serve functions such as sensing or computing. The &quot;bridges&quot; refer 
to stretchable wire segments that connect the islands. These lines link all the luminescent parts and

transmit signals. A key feature of the island-bridge structure is that it enables the lines to function like 
elastic iron wires: when the lines are under stress, they can stretch and bend without being damaged 
or broken. The &quot;islands&quot; remain unaffected and suffer almost no damage. Such islands can well 
provide a stable foundation for integrating today’s OLEDs into flexible electronic devices. There are 
different types of islands, and common bridge designs include folded bridges, bending bridges, fractal 
bridges, and serpentine bridges. 
2.2.1 Fold bridge and curved bridge 
Folded bridges and curved bridges are similar to each other, with comparable mechanisms for 
withstanding mechanical stress and exhibiting elasticity. The wires are attached to the bottom of each 
non-stretchable component, which are the &quot;islands&quot;. When pressure is applied to the devices, the 
bridges undergo compression. This process is reversible, so waves form on the bridges while the 
wires remain undamaged [10]. The difference between folded bridges and curved bridges is that 
curved bridges are fully attached to the substrate, whereas folded bridges are only attached to the 
&quot;islands&quot; at both ends, as shown in Fig. 2. These two types of interconnecting bridges have the 
advantages of simple fabrication and the ability to withstand relatively high mechanical stress. 
However, they also have shortcomings: they cannot be used in large-sized devices and cannot be 
mass-produced.

2.2.2 Serpentine bridge. 
Serpentine bridges are more stretchable in comparison with the other two types of bridges, 
making them the most common type of bridge. A serpentine bridge can either be fully attached to the 
substrate or only attached to the &quot;islands&quot; at the two ends—this design allows it to change its shape 
freely between the two ends. When the mechanical stress applied to the bridge is small, the bridge’s 
arched structure gradually unfolds and straightens. When the mechanical stress applied to the bridge 
increases, the arched structure begins to fold. Its deformation from 2D to 3D enables the bridge to 
easily withstand greater mechanical stress. 
2.2.3 Fractal bridge 
To form this type of bridge (note: typically referring to &quot;fractal bridges&quot; based on context), wires 
and non-stretchable components are combined to form a complex geometric pattern. It is similar to 
serpentine bridges but offers more efficient space utilization, as it can unfold in multiple directions. 
Mechanical stress is distributed more evenly across it, allowing it to withstand higher levels of 
mechanical stress than serpentine bridges. However, it has shortcomings: its complex structure makes 
it difficult to design and fabricate.

3. Intrinsically Stretchable Materials 
Existing methods—such as incorporating rigid nanostructures or engineering deformations in 
elastomers—allow for stretching but often result in degraded device performance or resolution. 
Research has focused on electroluminescent layers (EMLs), where stretchability is improved by 
blending polymers, adding additives (e.g., Triton X-100), or modifying molecular structures. 
However, relatively little attention has been paid to other functional layers and the overall device 
fabrication process. 
In intrinsically stretchable solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (is-OLEDs), solvent 
incompatibility is a major challenge, as it can disrupt the morphological structure of underlying layers. 
Lamination techniques are often used to address this issue, but this approach leads to orientation 
errors, spacing issues, and poor durability under repeated stretching. Electrodes represent another 
bottleneck: metals like silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al) have excellent conductivity but lack 
stretchability, while alternative materials (e.g., silver nanowires, graphene, or PEDOT:PSS) require 
complex transfer steps and exhibit lower conductivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop 
intrinsically stretchable OLEDs with improved transport layers and electrodes, as well as simplified 
preparation processes. The research team led by Professor Jionghui Wu at Nanjing University has 
achieved a latest breakthrough in this field. In their study, an intrinsically stretchable OLED (is-
OLED) was developed using a systematic fabrication process: (1) The light-emitting layer (LEL) was 
prepared by mixing the commercial polymer Super Yellow (SY) with the surfactant Triton X-100 
(TX);
