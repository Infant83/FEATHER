      &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;ABSTRACT While blue pixels consume approximately 50% of the energy of organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) display front planes, in the 25 years since their invention, 100% internal efficiency phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) have not met the stability standards necessary for their adoption. In this perspective, we discuss the significant progress and challenges encountered during this long journey of exploration and discovery. Today, using a combination of solutions including robust molecular design, graded doping of the emission layer, increasing the optical density of states to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime, and employing light outcoupling schemes, deep blue PHOLEDs are now achieving lifetimes approaching those of their green analogs. This perspective elaborates on the challenges and opportunities confronting further development of triplet‐controlled emitters, including PHOLEDs using heavy‐metal phosphors and thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs. We also address some persistent problems commonly found in the literature concerning the measurement of quantum efficiency and operational lifetime.&quot;,

      &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;With the recently rapid development of flexible electronics, stretchable OLEDs has become a significant direction to study because of its strong potential, like its ultra-thin structure, self-emissive nature, bendability, and stretchability. This new technology not only overcomes the limitations of traditional rigid screens, but also provides new opportunities in developing other fields, for example healthcare and human-computer interaction. From this perspective, the existing technology of OLED and its applications in different fields deserve attention. Firstly, it introduces the laser programming Buckling Process, three different island-bridge structures, Fold Bridge and Curved Bridge, Serpentine Bridge and Fractal Bridge, and talks about the Intrinsically stretchable materials. It then gives a few examples of applications in different fields, including Heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, Variable-size screens and wearable devices and Phototherapy. This article not only makes a conclusion of current technological achievements and challenges of stretchable OLEDs but also makes a foundation for the future development of this field.&quot;,

      &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Abstract Over the past few decades, organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) have demonstrated compelling technological advantages due to their ability to directly convert electrons into photons without requiring backlighting, thereby offering self‐emissive surfaces, ultrathin device profiles, compatibility with flexible substrates, high luminance, and exceptional contrast ratios (achieving true black). Today, OLEDs dominate the market for small‐scale displays such as smartphones and laptops. Propelled by the burgeoning ubiquity of the Internet of Things, OLEDs are poised to experience an exponential upsurge in prospective exigency. However, conventional thermal evaporation techniques face challenges in achieving uniform large‐area OLED fabrication, rendering mass production costly and complex—a persistent drawback hindering OLEDs from becoming the undisputed market leader. Amidst this milieu, inkjet printing (IJP) has magnetized considerable scholarly and commercial traction across the panoply of fabrication modalities, crystallizing as the pre‐eminent candidate for scalable, large‐area OLED manufacturing. This technique boasts non‐contact processing, high material utilization, and compatibility with roll‐to‐roll manufacturing. In this review, the critical parameters governing ink formulation are delineated and provide an overview of prevailing OLED device architectures. Subsequently, recent advancements are consolidate in inkjet‐printed OLED layers, culminating in a circumspect prognosis of the extant impediments and the prospective trajectory toward wholly inkjet‐patterned OLED architectures.&quot;,

      &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;While researchers in both industry and academia are racing to build quantum computing (QC) platforms with viable performance and functionality, the environmental impacts of this endeavor, such as its carbon footprint, e-waste generation, mineral use, and water and energy consumption, remain largely unknown. A similar oversight occurred during the semiconductor revolution and continues to have disastrous consequences for the health of our planet. As we build the quantum computing stack from the ground up, it is crucial to comprehensively assess it through an environmental sustainability lens for its entire lifecycle: production, use, and disposal. In this article, we highlight the need and challenges in establishing a QC sustainability benchmark that enables researchers to make informed architectural design decisions and celebrate the potential “quantum climate advantage.” We propose a carbon-aware quantum computing (CQC) framework that provides the foundational methodology and open research questions in calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a QC platform. Our call to action to the research community is the establishment of a new research direction known as sustainable quantum computing (SQC) that promotes quantum computing for both sustainability-oriented applications and the sustainability of quantum computing itself.&quot;,

Through analysis of industry roadmaps, recent technological breakthroughs, and expert predictions, we project that quantum computers in 2035 will feature: Physical Qubits: 100,000 to 1,000,000+ physical qubits in leading systems Logical Qubits: 1,000 to 10,000 error-corrected logical qubits Error Rates: Logical error rates below 10⁻⁹ per operation Commercial Status: Multiple platforms achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with real-world applications Market Size: $28-72 billion quantum computing market (McKinsey estimate) This analysis examines current technological trajectories, the critical December 2024 Google Willow breakthrough, scaling challenges, and the convergence of multiple quantum computing platforms toward practical utility.&quot;,
