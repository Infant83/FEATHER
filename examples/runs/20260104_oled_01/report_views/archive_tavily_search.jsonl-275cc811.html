          &quot;content&quot;: &quot;OLED displays are mainly made by Samsung Display and LG Display. OLED technology is used in commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players, car radios and digital cameras among others, as well as lighting. Such portable display applications favor the high light output of OLEDs for readability in sunlight and their low power drain. Portable displays are also used intermittently, so the lower lifespan of organic displays is less of an issue. Prototypes have been made of flexible and rollable displays which use OLEDs&#x27; unique characteristics. Applications in flexible signs and lighting are also being developed. OLED lighting offers several advantages over LED lighting, such as higher quality illumination, more diffuse light source, and panel [...] ## Working principle\n\n[edit]\n\nA typical OLED is composed of a layer of organic materials situated between two electrodes, the anode and cathode, all deposited on a substrate \&quot;Substrate (materials science)\&quot;). The organic molecules are electrically conductive as a result of delocalization of pi electrons caused by conjugation over part or all of the molecule. These materials have conductivity levels ranging from insulators to conductors, and are therefore considered organic semiconductors. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of organic semiconductors are analogous to the valence and conduction bands of inorganic semiconductors. [...] The bottom-emission organic light-emitting diode (BE-OLED) is the architecture that was used in the early-stage AMOLED displays. It had a transparent anode fabricated on a glass substrate, and a shiny reflective cathode. Light is emitted from the transparent anode direction. To reflect all the light towards the anode direction, a relatively thick metal cathode such as aluminum is used. For the anode, high-transparency indium tin oxide (ITO) was a typical choice to emit as much light as possible. Organic thin-films, including the emissive layer that actually generates the light, are then sandwiched between the ITO anode and the reflective metal cathode. The downside of bottom emission structure is that the light has to travel through the pixel drive circuits such as the thin-film&quot;,

When electrical current is applied, a bright light is emitted. OLEDs are emissive displays that do not require a backlight and so are thinner and more efficient than LCD displays (which do require a white backlight). [...] OLED displays are not just thin and efficient - they provide the best image quality ever and they can also be made transparent, flexible, foldable and even rollable and stretchable in the future. OLEDs represent the future of display technology!\n\n## OLED vs LCD\n\nAn OLED display have the following advantages over an LCD display:\n\n Improved image quality - better contrast, higher brightness, fuller viewing angle, a wider color range and much faster refresh rates.\n Lower power consumption.\n Simpler design that enables ultra-thin, flexible, foldable and transparent displays\n Better durability - OLEDs are very durable and can operate in a broader temperature range [...] ## OLED lighting\n\nOLEDs can be used to create excellent light source. OLED lighting panels offer highly uniform area lighting and can be flexible, efficient, light, thin, transparent, color-tunable and more. OLEDs enable new designs and these devices emit healthier light compared to CFLs and LED lighting devices. The OLED Lighting industry haven&#x27;t yet managed to reach mass production, but adoption in niche applications, mainly automotive, is on the rise.\n\n## About OLED-Info.com\n\nOLED-Info is a knowledge hub focused on the OLED industry, in operation since 2004.

OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode, producing light by passing an electric current through a thin layer of organic material. This results in a high contrast ratio, wide viewing angles, and low power consumption compared to other display technologies like LCD. It is also lighter due to not needing a backlight, which is crucial in handheld devices.\n\n## What is an OLED? [...] ### Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of OLED\n\nAdvantages:\n\n OLEDs use less power than LCDs since they generate light directly.\n OLEDs are very thin and lightweight, making them ideal for portable devices. OLEDs use fewer layers than LCDs, making them thinner and lighter without sacrificing performance or battery life.\n OLEDs have better viewing angles and contrast ratios than LCDs do; they&#x27;re closer in performance to CRT monitors when it comes to color accuracy at various angles in front of you.\n OLED technology has a very wide operating temperature which can go -40~80°C. Typically for LCDs such as TFT, we have -20 ~70°C; in some exceptional cases, we have -30°C~80°C.\n\nDisadvantages:&quot;,

          &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### Structure of OLEDs\n\nAn OLED is a solid-state device consisting of a thin, carbon-based semiconductor layer that emits light when electricity is applied by adjacent electrodes. In order for light to escape from the device, at least one of the electrodes must be transparent. The intensity of the light emitted is controlled by the amount of electric current applied by the electrodes, and the light&#x27;s color is determined by the type of emissive material used. To create white light, most devices use red, green, and blue emitters that can be arranged in several configurations, as illustrated below.\n\n#### Advantages of OLEDs [...] # OLED Basics\n\nOLEDs are organic LEDs, which means that their key building blocks are organic (i.e., carbon-based) materials. Unlike LEDs, which are small-point light sources, OLEDs are made in sheets that are diffuse-area light sources. OLED technology is developing rapidly, and there are a handful of product offerings with efficacy, lifetime, and color quality specs that are comparable to their LED counterparts. However, OLEDs are still some years away from widespread use as a source of general illumination, largely due to their high cost.\n\n#### Structure of OLEDs [...] with the diffuse nature of OLED lighting, could enable an entirely new type of light and light fixture that&#x27;s both attractive and highly efficient. OLEDs can also be made in almost any shape, can be deposited on flexible substrates, and can be transparent, emitting light from both sides of the device—features that greatly expand the design possibilities, allowing for a completely new lighting experience.&quot;,

These devices use LED technology and use an organic material as a light emitting layer. Organic LEDs can produce high quality displays with high contrasts, high viewing angles and true blacks. Some say that OLEDs produce the world’s best display panels. [...] In OLED display screens, each pixel is controlled individually and emits its own light (unlike LCDs in which the light comes from a backlighting unit). This is known as an emissive display. OLED displays deliver great image quality - bright colors, fast motion and most importantly - very high contrast. Most notably, “real” blacks (that cannot be achieved in LCDs due to the backlighting). The simple OLED design also means that it is relatively easy to produce flexible and transparent displays.\n\n## Where can OLEDs be found today?\n\nOver 1 billion OLED panels are produced annually, by various display makers, and the market continues to grow as OLEDs offer better image quality, smaller form factors and flexibility - things that are hard to achieve with LCDs. [...] OLEDs are most popularly used to make OLED TVs - some of the world’s top TV panels are produced based on innovative OLED technology. Various TV companies use OLED technologies to produce award-winning premium OLED TVs, including LG, Phillips and Samsung.\n\nThese displays consistently achieve outstanding image quality and ultra-thin form factors. However, OLED TVs remain expensive due to their high production costs, especially over large areas.\n\nOLEDs are also used in mobile devices - many high-end smartphones use them. For example, Apple&#x27;s flagship iPhones have featured OLED displays since 2017, which offer vibrant colors and deep blacks. Additionally, the thin and versatile nature of OLED technology has made innovative new designs useful such as the Samsung Galaxy foldable phones.&quot;,

          &quot;content&quot;: &quot;OLEDs do not require backlighting like LCDs (see How LCDs Work). LCDs work by selectively blocking areas of the backlight to make the images that you see, while OLEDs generate light themselves. Because OLEDs do not require backlighting, they consume much less power than LCDs (most of the LCD power goes to the backlighting). This is especially important for battery-operated devices such as cell phones.\n OLEDs are easier to produce and can be made to larger sizes. Because OLEDs are essentially plastics, they can be made into large, thin sheets. It is much more difficult to grow and lay down so many liquid crystals. [...] The plastic, organic layers of an OLED are thinner, lighter and more flexible than the crystalline layers in an LED or LCD.\n Because the light-emitting layers of an OLED are lighter, the substrate of an OLED can be flexible instead of rigid. OLED substrates can be plastic rather than the glass used for LEDs and LCDs.\n OLEDs are brighter than LEDs. Because the organic layers of an OLED are much thinner than the corresponding inorganic crystal layers of an LED, the conductive and emissive layers of an OLED can be multi-layered. Also, LEDs and LCDs require glass for support, and glass absorbs some light. OLEDs do not require glass. [...] OLEDs have large fields of view, about 170 degrees. Because LCDs work by blocking light, they have an inherent viewing obstacle from certain angles. OLEDs produce their own light, so they have a much wider viewing range.&quot;,
