For the anode, high-transparency indium tin oxide (ITO) was a typical choice to emit as much light as possible.

In order for light to escape from the device, at least one of the electrodes must be transparent.

These devices use LED technology and use an organic material as a light emitting layer. Organic LEDs can produce high quality displays with high contrasts, high viewing angles and true blacks. Some say that OLEDs produce the world’s best display panels. [...] In OLED display screens, each pixel is controlled individually and emits its own light (unlike LCDs in which the light comes from a backlighting unit). This is known as an emissive display. OLED displays deliver great image quality - bright colors, fast motion and most importantly - very high contrast. Most notably, “real” blacks (that cannot be achieved in LCDs due to the backlighting). The simple OLED design also means that it is relatively easy to produce flexible and transparent displays.\n\n## Where can OLEDs be found today?\n\nOver 1 billion OLED panels are produced annually, by various display makers, and the market continues to grow as OLEDs offer better image quality, smaller form factors and flexibility - things that are hard to achieve with LCDs. [...] OLEDs are most popularly used to make OLED TVs - some of the world’s top TV panels are produced based on innovative OLED technology. Various TV companies use OLED technologies to produce award-winning premium OLED TVs, including LG, Phillips and Samsung.\n\nThese displays consistently achieve outstanding image quality and ultra-thin form factors. However, OLED TVs remain expensive due to their high production costs, especially over large areas.\n\nOLEDs are also used in mobile devices - many high-end smartphones use them. For example, Apple's flagship iPhones have featured OLED displays since 2017, which offer vibrant colors and deep blacks. Additionally, the thin and versatile nature of OLED technology has made innovative new designs useful such as the Samsung Galaxy foldable phones.", "score": 0.64746445, "raw_content": null, "summary": "Over 1 billion OLED panels are produced annually, by various display makers, and the market continues to grow as OLEDs offer better image quality, smaller form factors and flexibility - things that are hard to achieve with LCDs.

This is especially important for battery-operated devices such as cell phones.\n OLEDs are easier to produce and can be made to larger sizes.

A bit is a unit of information that can store either a zero or a one. By contrast, quantum computing is built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store both zeros _and_ ones. Qubits can represent any combination of both zero and one simultaneously; this is called superposition, and it is a basic feature of any quantum state. When a qubit’s subatomic particles are in a superposition state, each subatomic particle can interact with and influence others, a phenomenon called quantum interference.
