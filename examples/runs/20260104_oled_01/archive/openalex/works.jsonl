In this perspective, we discuss the significant progress and challenges encountered during this long journey of exploration and discovery. Today, using a combination of solutions including robust molecular design, graded doping of the emission layer, increasing the optical density of states to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime, and employing light outcoupling schemes, deep blue PHOLEDs are now achieving lifetimes approaching those of their green analogs. This perspective elaborates on the challenges and opportunities confronting further development of triplet‐controlled emitters, including PHOLEDs using heavy‐metal phosphors and thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs. We also address some persistent problems commonly found in the literature concerning the measurement of quantum efficiency and operational lifetime.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202519327", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "cited_by_count": 0, "pdf_url": null, "pdf_urls": [], "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202519327", "is_oa": true, "oa_status": "hybrid"}}

Today, OLEDs dominate the market for small‐scale displays such as smartphones and laptops. Propelled by the burgeoning ubiquity of the Internet of Things, OLEDs are poised to experience an exponential upsurge in prospective exigency. However, conventional thermal evaporation techniques face challenges in achieving uniform large‐area OLED fabrication, rendering mass production costly and complex—a persistent drawback hindering OLEDs from becoming the undisputed market leader. Amidst this milieu, inkjet printing (IJP) has magnetized considerable scholarly and commercial traction across the panoply of fabrication modalities, crystallizing as the pre‐eminent candidate for scalable, large‐area OLED manufacturing. This technique boasts non‐contact processing, high material utilization, and compatibility with roll‐to‐roll manufacturing. In this review, the critical parameters governing ink formulation are delineated and provide an overview of prevailing OLED device architectures. Subsequently, recent advancements are consolidate in inkjet‐printed OLED layers, culminating in a circumspect prognosis of the extant impediments and the prospective trajectory toward wholly inkjet‐patterned OLED architectures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/adom.202502807", "journal": "Advanced Optical Materials", "cited_by_count": 0, "pdf_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/adom.202502807", "pdf_urls": ["https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/adom.202502807"], "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/adom.202502807", "is_oa": true, "oa_status": "bronze"}}

A similar oversight occurred during the semiconductor revolution and continues to have disastrous consequences for the health of our planet. As we build the quantum computing stack from the ground up, it is crucial to comprehensively assess it through an environmental sustainability lens for its entire lifecycle: production, use, and disposal. In this article, we highlight the need and challenges in establishing a QC sustainability benchmark that enables researchers to make informed architectural design decisions and celebrate the potential “quantum climate advantage.” We propose a carbon-aware quantum computing (CQC) framework that provides the foundational methodology and open research questions in calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a QC platform.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (2020–2024) investigating postoperative outcomes in breast cancer patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ≤90 days before surgery versus contemporaneous non-infected controls treated at the same institutions and in the same period. PROSPERO CRD420251174613. Random-effects models (DerSimonian–Laird with Hartung–Knapp adjustment) were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, and certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Results: Twelve prospective cohort studies, including 7812 patients, compared breast cancer surgery after recent confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over 90 days with contemporaneous non-infected controls treated at the same centres. Overall, recent infection was associated with higher 30-day postoperative complications (Clavien–Dindo ≥ II) compared to. non-infected patients (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.44–2.81) and increased venous thromboembolism (3.6%vs. 1.2%; OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.29–7.55). Early surgery 14 days after infection carried the highest risk of complications (OR 4.38, 95 CI 2.31–8.30), whereas operations performed ≥6 weeks yielded outcomes comparable to non-infected controls (OR 1.03, 95 CI 0.81–1.31); 30-day mortality remained very low (0.3). Conclusions: Breast cancer surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with excess perioperative risk only when performed within the first two weeks. Delaying surgery to approximately six weeks minimises complications and VTE without compromising short-term safety.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm15010341", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Medicine", "cited_by_count": 0, "pdf_url": null, "pdf_urls": [], "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm15010341", "is_oa": true, "oa_status": "gold"}}
