Across industries, AI is moving beyond answering questions to collaborating with people and amplifying their expertise.\n\nThis transformation is visible everywhere. In medicine, AI is helping close gaps in care. In software development, it’s learning not just code but the context behind it. In scientific research, it’s becoming a true lab assistant. In quantum computing, new hybrid approaches are heralding breakthroughs once thought impossible. [...] As AI agents become digital colleagues and take on specific tasks at human direction, organizations are strengthening security to keep pace with new risks. The infrastructure powering these advances is also maturing, with smarter, more efficient systems.\n\nThese seven trends to watch in 2026 show what’s possible when people join forces with AI.\n\nImage 4\n\nAI will amplify what people can achieve together\n\nAparna Chennapragada, Microsoft’s chief product officer for AI experiences, sees 2026 as a new era for alliances between technology and people. If recent years were about AI answering questions and reasoning through problems, the next wave will be about true collaboration, Chennapragada says.\n\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans,” she says. “It’s about amplifying them.” [...] Image 7\n\nAI will become central to the research process\n\nAI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research.

Louis Shipley: Entrepreneurial competition in AI remains fierce\n\nAs we enter 2026, we are in the midst of a massive AI buildout. This creates enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors.  \n  \nClearly, AI is transforming the economy. It’s easy and in fact natural to get caught up in the euphoria. For entrepreneurs, it is critical to ensure your AI startup solves a real problem by addressing verifiable customer pain.

Across industries, AI is moving beyond answering questions to collaborating with people and amplifying their expertise.\n\nThis transformation is visible everywhere. In medicine, AI is helping close gaps in care. In software development, it’s learning not just code but the context behind it. In scientific research, it’s becoming a true lab assistant. In quantum computing, new hybrid approaches are heralding breakthroughs once thought impossible. [...] As AI agents become digital colleagues and take on specific tasks at human direction, organizations are strengthening security to keep pace with new risks. The infrastructure powering these advances is also maturing, with smarter, more efficient systems.\n\nThese seven trends to watch in 2026 show what’s possible when people join forces with AI.\n\nImage 4\n\nAI will amplify what people can achieve together\n\nAparna Chennapragada, Microsoft’s chief product officer for AI experiences, sees 2026 as a new era for alliances between technology and people. If recent years were about AI answering questions and reasoning through problems, the next wave will be about true collaboration, Chennapragada says.\n\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans,” she says. “It’s about amplifying them.” [...] Image 7\n\nAI will become central to the research process\n\nAI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. But the next leap is coming. In 2026, AI won’t just summarize papers, answer questions and write reports — it will actively join the process of discovery in physics, chemistry and biology.\n\n“AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,” Lee says.", "score": 0.92588276, "raw_content": null, "summary": "“It’s about amplifying them.” [...] Image 7 AI will become central to the research process AI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. “AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,”"}, {"url": "https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/ai-trends-for-2026-building-change-fitness-and-balancing-trade-offs", "title": "AI Trends for 2026: Building 'Change Fitness' and Balancing Trade ...", "content": "Skip to Main Content\n\nHarvard Business School\n\nWorking Knowledge\n\nWorking Knowledge\n\nDistilling Harvard Business School research for leaders who make a difference\n\nWorking Knowledge\n\nStrategy and Innovation\n\n# AI Trends for 2026: Building 'Change Fitness' and Balancing Trade-Offs\n\nBy Rachel Layne on\n\nMany organizations will seek to gain more value from artificial intelligence in 2026.

Louis Shipley: Entrepreneurial competition in AI remains fierce\n\nAs we enter 2026, we are in the midst of a massive AI buildout. This creates enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors.  \n  \nClearly, AI is transforming the economy. It’s easy and in fact natural to get caught up in the euphoria. For entrepreneurs, it is critical to ensure your AI startup solves a real problem by addressing verifiable customer pain.
