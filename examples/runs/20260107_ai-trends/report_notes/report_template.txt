Template description: MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies-style list report.

Template tone: Clear, editorial, evidence-backed, forward-looking.

Template audience: Technical leaders, policy makers, strategists.

Section guidance:
- Executive Summary: 5-7 sentences; highlight overall signals and time horizon.
- How We Chose: state selection criteria (impact, feasibility, evidence, timeframe).
- Breakthroughs (Top 10): use H3 numbered entries; each entry includes "What it is", "Why it matters", "Key players", "Availability".
- Cross-Cutting Themes: 3-5 themes derived from the list; cite evidence.
- Industry Implications: near-term adoption paths and decision points.
- Risks & Gaps: where evidence is weak; possible overhype.

Template writing guidance:
Keep each breakthrough entry concise and comparable.
Use short paragraphs and bullet lists inside each entry.
Avoid hype; separate observed evidence from projection.
Use consistent sublabels per item (What it is / Why it matters / Key players / Availability).
