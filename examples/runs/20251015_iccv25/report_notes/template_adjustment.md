## Guidance Overrides
- Executive Summary: 5-7 sentences; claim -> evidence -> implication.
- Key Findings: 3-6 items with evidence and caveats.
- Trends & Implications: connect signals to near-term decisions.
- Risks & Gaps: highlight missing evidence, constraints, and unknowns. If not applicable, state Not applicable and give a brief reason; scale depth to evidence strength and context.
- Critics: short headline + paragraphs + bullets; include contrarian views. If not applicable, state Not applicable and give a brief reason; scale depth to evidence strength and context.

## Writer Guidance Additions
- Synthesize across sources; avoid lists of summaries.
- Separate facts from interpretation; label web-derived support.
- Maintain a critical, evidence-based review tone.
