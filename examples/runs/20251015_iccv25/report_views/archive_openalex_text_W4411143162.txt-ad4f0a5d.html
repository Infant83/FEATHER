Xingxing Weng, Chao Pang, and Gui-Song Xia
Abstract—Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge
the information gap between images and natural language.
Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on massive image-
text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in
the remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The
resulting models benefit from the absorption of extensive general
knowledge and demonstrate strong performance across a variety
of remote sensing data analysis tasks. Moreover, they are capable
of interacting with users in a conversational manner. In this
paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with
a timely and comprehensive review of the developments in
VLM using the two-stage paradigm. Specifically, we first cover
a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing: contrastive learning,
visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image genera-
tion. For each category, we detail the commonly used network
architecture and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a
thorough review of existing works, examining foundation models
and task-specific adaptation methods in contrastive-based VLM,
architectural upgrades, training strategies and model capabilities
in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation
models with their representative downstream applications. Third,
we summarize datasets used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning,
and evaluation, with an analysis of their construction method-
ologies (including image sources and caption generation) and
key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally, we
conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future
research directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague
requirement comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability,
continually scalable model capabilities, and large-scale datasets
featuring richer modalities and greater challenges.

ISION-language modeling (VLM) in remote sensing,
aiming to bridge the information gap between remote
sensing images and natural language, facilitates a deeper
understanding of remote sensing scene semantics like the
attributes of ground objects and their relationship, and enables
more natural human interaction with intelligent remote sensing
data analysis models or methods [17], [164]. Since the intro-
duction of remote sensing tasks such as image captioning [62],
visual question answering [54], text-image (or image-text)
retrieval [166], and text-based image generation [165], VLM
in remote sensing has achieved significant success, driven by
advancements in deep learning.

Fig. 1. The number of publications on visual-language modeling in remote
sensing using the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.
Early works on VLM primarily emphasize the careful
design of model architectures, followed by supervised training
from scratch on small-scale datasets. For example, in image
captioning research, many efforts [167]–[170] have been made
to effectively combine convolutional neural networks (e.g.
VGG [171] and ResNet [172]) with sequential models (e.g.
LSTM [173] and Transformer [174]) before training on UCM-
captions [62] and Sydney-captions [62] datasets. Under this
classical construction paradigm, deep models often excel on
test datasets but struggle to perform satisfactorily in large-scale
deployments. Moreover, although these models are capable of
describing image content, they fall short when tasked with
answering questions about the images. In other words, they
struggle to accomplish related tasks, such as visual question
answering. The task-specific nature of these models seriously
limits their applicability across diverse scenarios.
Recently, a new paradigm of pre-training followed by fine-
tuning provides a promising solution to address the challenges
mentioned above. The core idea is to first pre-train a model
on massive image-text data, enabling it to capture general
knowledge that covers a wide range of visual and textual
concepts, along with their underlying correspondence. The
pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on task-specific training
data. The integration of general knowledge has been shown
to enhance the model’s generalization ability in a single
task [7], [8], while also making it more versatile and capable of
handling a variety of downstream tasks [1], [3]. Consequently,
vision-language modeling with this new paradigm has emerged
as a prominent research focus in the field of remote sensing.

Fig. 2. Overview of this survey.
To date, significant progress has been achieved, as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. This includes works based on 1) contrastive
learning [175], such as GeoRSCLIP [7], SkyCLIP [8] and
RemoteCLIP [2], which have driven substantial advancements
in various cross-modal tasks and zero-shot image understand-
ing tasks. 2) learning an implicit joint distribution between
text and images, like RS-SD [7], DiffusionSat [38] and CRS-
Diff [39], which allow for image generation from text prompts.
3) visual instruction tuning [201], such as GeoChat [3], LHRS-
Bot [9], and SkySenseGPT [11], which have demonstrated
improved performance, diverse capabilities, and conversational
interactions in remote sensing data analysis.
Despite these remarkable achievements, it is widely ac-
knowledged that VLM remains an open challenge. Indeed, ex-
isting works have not yet achieved the level of remote sensing
experts in processing remote sensing data. To provide clarity
and motivation for further advances in the research community,
several surveys have reviewed vision-language modeling in
remote sensing. For instance, Li et al. [17] summarize vision-
language models from an application perspective and suggest
potential research opportunities. However, due to time con-
straints, they primarily concentrate on vision-only foundation
models and early works. Zhou et al. [16] review recent devel-
opments but lack an in-depth analysis of key designs, which
is significant for inspiring future research. Moreover, datasets,
as a prerequisite of visual-language modeling research, have
not been given adequate attention in existing surveys.
In this work, we aim to provide a timely and comprehensive
review of the literature, with a focus on vision-language
modeling based on the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
in the field of remote sensing. Specifically, we cover: 1) a
taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing, detailing commonly
used network architectures and pre-training objectives for
each category; 2) the latest advancements in contrastive-based,
instruction-based, and generation-based vision-language mod-
eling in remote sensing, highlighting key designs and down-
stream applications; 3) progress in datasets for VLM pre-
training, fine-tuning, and evaluation; 4) several challenges and
potential research directions. Fig. 2 presents an overview of
this paper.
II. THE TAXONOMY OF VISUAL-LANGUAGE MODELING
IN REMOTE SENSING
Under the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, vision-
language modeling in remote sensing can be divided into
three distinct groups based on their strategies for bridging the
two modalities in the pre-training phase: contrastive learning,
visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image gener-
ation. In this section, we present commonly used network
architectures and pre-training objectives within each group.
Contrastive Learning: The motivation behind applying
contrastive learning to vision-language modeling is training a
model to map vision and language into a shared representation
space, where an image and its corresponding text share similar
representations while differing from other texts, which was
first implemented by the pioneering work CLIP [86] in the
field of computer vision. As illustrated in Fig.3 (a), CLIP uti-
lizes two independent encoders responsible for encoding visual
and textual information. Given a batch of N image-text pairs
{(xi, yi)}N
i=1, the embeddings extracted by the two encoders
followed by normalization are {eI
i , eT
i }N
i=1. To achieve the
similarity between visual and textual representations, CLIP is
trained to maximize the cosine similarity of the embeddings
of the ith image and the corresponding ith text (i ∈[N] with
[N] = {1, 2, . . . , N}), while minimizing the cosine similarity
of the embeddings of the ith image and jth text (i, j ∈[N],
i ̸= j). The loss is computed using InfoNCE [176] as follows:
LInfoNCE = −1
2N
PN

ii, {sI
ij}N
j=1) + log στ(sT

where sI
ij = S(eI
i , eT
j ) and sT
ij = S(eT
i , eI
j) are the similarity
scores between the image and text embeddings, as com-
puted by the function S(e, e

Based on the strategies employed to bridge remote sensing images and natural language during the pre-training phase, vision-language modeling
(VLM) in remote sensing can be categorized into three groups: (a) contrastive learning, (b) visual instruction tuning, and (c) text-conditioned image generation.

The original CLIP model was trained on 400 million image-
text pairs collected from the Internet and has demonstrated
impressive results across various computer vision tasks [177]–
[179]. These advancements spark interest in extending its
capability to advance vision-language modeling in remote
sensing. Two primary lines of research have been actively
explored. The first, following the CLIP learning way, focuses
on pre-training foundation models that are task-agnostic but
specifically adapted for remote sensing domain. This includes
efforts such as constructing large-scale image-text datasets [7],
[8] and developing novel pre-training objectives [4], [26]. The
second line explores effective adaptation of pre-trained CLIP
models toward diverse downstream tasks, including image
captioning [14], [19], zero-shot scene classification [20], [25],
image-text retrieval [15], [31], etc.
Visual Instruction Tuning: Optimizing a model from
scratch for image-text alignment is extremely resource-
intensive due to the need for vast amounts of data and
computational power. Fortunately, many pre-trained vision
encoders and language models have been released. Pre-trained
vision encoders can provide high-quality visual representa-
tions, while pre-trained language models, particularly large
language models (LLMs), demonstrate advanced language un-
derstanding capabilities. As a result, recent works increasingly
leverage these models to achieve image-text alignment through
visual instruction tuning, as introduced by LLaVA [201] and
MiniGPT-4 [129]. Fig.3 (b) illustrates a network architecture
for this type of work, consisting of three key components: a
pre-trained vision encoder, a connector, and a large language
model. Specifically, the vision encoder compresses remote
sensing images into compact visual representations, while the
connector maps image embeddings into the word embedding
space of the LLM. The LLM then receives both visual
information and language instructions to perform reasoning
tasks. Different from CLIP, which directly takes images and
corresponding texts as input, this type of work preprocesses
image-text pairs to instruction-following data. In this setup,
each image is accompanied by a question, or language in-
struction, requiring the LLM to describe the image, while the
corresponding text serves as the ground truth for the LLM’s
predictions. Denote a batch of instruction-following data as
{(xi, qi, yi)}N
i=1, where qi is the question associated with the
ith image. The pre-training objective is defined as:
LVIT = −1
N
N
X
i=1
1
Li
Li
X
j=1
log P(wj|xi, qi, yi,&lt;j),
(2)
where Li is the length of the caption yi = {w1, w2, . . . , wLi},
yi,&lt;j denotes the masked sequence that contain only the
first j −1 words, and P(wj|xi, qi, yi,&lt;j) is the conditional
probability of generating the caption word wj given the image
xi, question qi and the previous words yi,&lt;j in the caption.
During pre-training, the vision encoder and large language
model are typically kept frozen, with only the parameters of
the connector being trainable.
In [129], [201], the authors demonstrated that pre-training
with visual instruction tuning can align vision and language
representations while preserving extensive knowledge. Since
then, advances have been made by modifying network ar-
chitectures and creating high-quality pre-training datasets [9],
[202]. In addition to improving alignment, another line of re-
search focuses on supervised fine-tuning, aiming to enable the
model to perform a variety of remote sensing image analysis
tasks and interact with users in a conversational manner. This
includes efforts to generate task-specific instruction-following
data [3], [5], [11], design novel training strategies [136], [202],
and incorporate cutting-edge vision encoders [136].
Text-Conditioned Image Generation: Taking advantage
of the advances in conditional image generation, a group of
works [7], [38], [39] uses off-the-shelf generative models,
primarily Stable Diffusion [203], to generate remote sensing
images given text prompts, which essentially learns an im-
plicit joint distribution between images and texts. As illus-
trated in Fig.3 (c), their network architecture comprises three
main components: a text encoder, a variational autoencoder
(VAE) [204], and a denoising U-Net.</pre></main>
