[...] The bottom-emission organic light-emitting diode (BE-OLED) is the architecture that was used in the early-stage AMOLED displays. It had a transparent anode fabricated on a glass substrate, and a shiny reflective cathode. Light is emitted from the transparent anode direction. To reflect all the light towards the anode direction, a relatively thick metal cathode such as aluminum is used. For the anode, high-transparency indium tin oxide (ITO) was a typical choice to emit as much light as possible.

In order for light to escape from the device, at least one of the electrodes must be transparent.

These devices use LED technology and use an organic material as a light emitting layer. Organic LEDs can produce high quality displays with high contrasts, high viewing angles and true blacks. Some say that OLEDs produce the world’s best display panels. [...] In OLED display screens, each pixel is controlled individually and emits its own light (unlike LCDs in which the light comes from a backlighting unit). This is known as an emissive display. OLED displays deliver great image quality - bright colors, fast motion and most importantly - very high contrast. Most notably, “real” blacks (that cannot be achieved in LCDs due to the backlighting). The simple OLED design also means that it is relatively easy to produce flexible and transparent displays.\n\n## Where can OLEDs be found today?\n\nOver 1 billion OLED panels are produced annually, by various display makers, and the market continues to grow as OLEDs offer better image quality, smaller form factors and flexibility - things that are hard to achieve with LCDs. [...] OLEDs are most popularly used to make OLED TVs - some of the world’s top TV panels are produced based on innovative OLED technology. Various TV companies use OLED technologies to produce award-winning premium OLED TVs, including LG, Phillips and Samsung.\n\nThese displays consistently achieve outstanding image quality and ultra-thin form factors. However, OLED TVs remain expensive due to their high production costs, especially over large areas.\n\nOLEDs are also used in mobile devices - many high-end smartphones use them. For example, Apple's flagship iPhones have featured OLED displays since 2017, which offer vibrant colors and deep blacks. Additionally, the thin and versatile nature of OLED technology has made innovative new designs useful such as the Samsung Galaxy foldable phones.", "score": 0.64746445, "raw_content": null, "summary": "Over 1 billion OLED panels are produced annually, by various display makers, and the market continues to grow as OLEDs offer better image quality, smaller form factors and flexibility - things that are hard to achieve with LCDs.

This is especially important for battery-operated devices such as cell phones.\n OLEDs are easier to produce and can be made to larger sizes. Because OLEDs are essentially plastics, they can be made into large, thin sheets. It is much more difficult to grow and lay down so many liquid crystals. [...] The plastic, organic layers of an OLED are thinner, lighter and more flexible than the crystalline layers in an LED or LCD.\n Because the light-emitting layers of an OLED are lighter, the substrate of an OLED can be flexible instead of rigid.

You take big bright LEDs and instead of one big light or some strips of light, you section them off into LED zones. If you need one section to be bright, you tell that zone to fire.

And behind that layer is some sort of giant light that lights up the pixels. Without that, the pixels need light around them to be seen, like old Game Boy Colors at night. Here's the problem with that. That's all fine and well for bright colors. If you want a bright red fire, turn it red and blast it with light. But what about dark scenes?

Quantum computing could also tackle climate modeling, financial forecasting, and even fundamental physics questions that we haven't cracked yet. It's not just about doing things faster. It's also about doing things we couldn't do before. Now, before you start picturing a quantum PC on your desk, let's pump the brakes a bit. Quantum computing is still very much in its early days, like in the vacuum tube or maybe even relay era of classical computing.

Quantum computing can enable AI applications to achieve the following milestones, which may eventually support AGI: [...] How does a quantum computer work?\n\nClassical computing, the technology that powers your laptop and smartphone, is built on bits. A bit is a unit of information that can store either a zero or a one. By contrast, quantum computing is built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store both zeros _and_ ones. Qubits can represent any combination of both zero and one simultaneously; this is called superposition, and it is a basic feature of any quantum state. When a qubit’s subatomic particles are in a superposition state, each subatomic particle can interact with and influence others, a phenomenon called quantum interference. Quantum chips make up the physical hardware that stores qubits, similar to microchips in classical computers.", "score": 0.8747745, "raw_content": null, "summary": "Quantum computers have the potential to solve very complex statistical problemsthat are well beyond the limits of today’s computers, across a range of industries and applications, including finance, transportation, pharmaceuticals, and green technology.

Infections in the past 30 days represent 40% of the total of 138 cattle herds infected in 12 states since the outbreak in dairy cattle was first reported on 25 March, the CDC reported. \n\nStates affected by avian flu spread in dairy cattle\n\nThe real number of infections of both humans and cattle is very likely underestimated, insofar as farmers have been reluctant to have their staff or herds tested, experts warn.\n\nEven so, the CDC maintained that infection risks for the general public remain low. [...] The APPC survey also found that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe that drinking raw milk is as safe as pasteurized milk (57% vs. 37%). People living in an urban environment also are more likely to believe that pastuerized milk is safer than raw milk as compared to people in a rural environment (49% vs. 32%).\n\n“The difference in views of raw milk that we see between Democrats and Republicans is difficult to disentangle from the difference between rural and urban dwellers,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “Those in rural areas are both more likely to identify as Republicans and to consume raw milk.”\n\n### 55 more dairy herds reported infected in last 30 days [...] Health Policy Watch\n\n### Share this:\n\nOver one-half of Americans are not sure if pasteurised milk is safer than raw milk. In the time of avian flu epidemics in US cattle, this could even prove dangerous.\n\nAs the fourth human case of H5N1 avian flu in a US farmworker in Colorado was confirmed Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), so far, only farm workers, and not consumers, have reported avian flu infections.\n\nThis is likely due, at least in part, to the successful inactivation of the virus during the milk pasteurization process, experts say.
