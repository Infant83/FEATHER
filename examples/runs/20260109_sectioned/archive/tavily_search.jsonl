Organizations should expect continued expansion of data privacy and AI governance requirements globally.\n Growing demand for compliant solutions. Multi-cloud and edge strategies will become more common as teams localize data and compute.\n Emergence of regional AI hubs. Governments and regions are likely to invest in local ecosystems to reduce reliance on external providers.\n\n## What AI trends in 2026 mean for healthcare leaders\n\nAgentic AI, physical AI and sovereign AI signal a shift in how artificial intelligence will be used across healthcare and life sciences. AI is taking on more responsibility, moving closer to real-world operations and operating under stricter expectations for transparency, control and compliance. [...] ### Early predictions for 2026\n\n Pilots move into production. As new agentic solutions mature, adoption is likely to expand beyond experimental use cases.\n Governance takes a stance. Autonomous systems raise new questions around accountability, validation and oversight that organizations can no longer defer.\n New roles emerge. Expect increased investment in upskilling, including teams focused on monitoring, training and governing AI agents.\n\n## Physical AI and its impact on real-world healthcare operations [...] As data volumes grow and decision cycles shorten, organizations need AI that accelerates insight while operating within strict privacy and governance guardrails.

Learn why they matter and what experts predict for the near future._\n\nAre you keeping up with the latest AI trends? Artificial intelligence is advancing at an astonishing speed. It’s hard to keep pace with all the new variations and frameworks that will reshape industries, economies, and daily life. Among the most influential trends driving innovation and disruption are agentic AI, physical AI, and sovereign AI. Each presents new opportunities and challenges for organizations and individuals. [...] These surveys reflect excitement and enthusiasm about agentic AI and physical AI and recognize the importance of sovereign AI to strategic planning. Increased efficiency, productivity, and innovation are among the likely results of these trends along with more robust guardrails to safeguard data and its usage worldwide.

The exploding market of “out-of-the box” agentic solutions for common use cases will expand usage of agents to more industries.\n\n2.

Physical AI Pilots Transform Manufacturing and Beyond\n\nSkilled labor shortages have become structural. Pipe fitters, technicians and experienced operators are in short supply worldwide. In 2026, manufacturers will turn to AI not just to save costs but to survive.\n\nAI will augment skilled workers by automating repetitive tasks, improving safety outcomes, optimizing supply chains and personalizing training at scale. Companies that embrace AI-driven productivity will dominate production and cost efficiency. Those that do not will fall behind quickly. [...] While many industries struggle to quantify AI returns, manufacturing offers controlled environments where results can be proven with complex numbers. Defect rates will drop, production will increase and cycle times will shrink. The industry will shift from pilots and experimentation to enterprise-wide, real-world production.\n\nBut AI will not be limited to algorithms and screens; it will also be on the production floor in the form of humanoid robotics. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang calls this the age of physical AI. Humanoid robots will transition from demonstrations to targeted commercial pilots in warehouses and factories (with leaders like Tesla, Figure and Agility aiming for thousands to tens of thousands of units), augmenting workers in controlled environments while proving safety and ROI. [...] 5. Agentic AI Runs Logistics and Production\n\nIn 2026, agentic AI will manage logistics and production end-to-end. AI agents will reroute inventory in real time, expedite shipments, allocate maintenance resources and dynamically adjust manufacturing based on need. Businesses that adopt agentic systems early will gain structural operational advantages over competitors.\n\n6. Amazon Reemerges as an AI Infrastructure Leader\n\nAfter a period of relative underperformance, Amazon will reassert itself in 2026 as AWS reaccelerates.

Davenport and Randy Bean see five AI trends to pay attention to in 2026: deflation of the AI ... bubble and subsequent hits to the economy; growth of the “factory” infrastructure for all-in AI adapters; greater focus on generative AI as an organizational resource rather than an individual one; continued progression toward value from agentic AI, despite the hype; and ongoing questions around who should manage data and AI.\n\nRead More + [...] Last year, like virtually everyone else, we predicted that agentic AI would be on the rise. Although we acknowledged that the technology was being hyped and had some challenges, we underestimated the degree of both. Agents turned out to be the most-hyped trend since, well, generative AI. GenAI now resides in the Gartner trough of disillusionment, which we predict agents will fall into in 2026. [...] Here are the emerging 2026 AI trends that leaders should understand and be prepared to act on.\n\n### 1. The AI bubble will deflate, and the economy will suffer.\n\nLast year, the elephant in the AI room was the rise of agentic AI (and it’s still clomping around; see below). This year, it’s the AI bubble that has monopolized discussion: Is there one? If so, when will it burst? Will the money rush out quickly or slowly?

Industry analysts project the market will surge from $7.8 billion today to over \\$52 billion by 2030, while Gartner predicts that 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. This growth isn’t only about deploying more agents. It’s about different architectures, protocols, and business models that are reshaping how we build and deploy AI systems. [...] ## Navigating the Agentic Transition\n\nThe trends shaping 2026 represent more than incremental improvements. They signal a restructuring of how we build, deploy, and govern AI systems. The organizations that will thrive are those that recognize agentic AI isn’t about smarter automation. It’s about new architectures (multi-agent orchestration), new standards (MCP/A2A protocols), new economics (FinOps for agents), and new organizational capabilities (governance maturity, workflow redesign).\n\nFor machine learning practitioners, the path forward is clear: [...] The agentic AI field is going through its microservices revolution. Just as monolithic applications gave way to distributed service architectures, single all-purpose agents are being replaced by orchestrated teams of specialized agents. Gartner reported a staggering 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025, signaling a shift in how systems are designed.\n\nRather than deploying one large LLM to handle everything, leading organizations are implementing “puppeteer” orchestrators that coordinate specialist agents. A researcher agent gathers information, a coder agent implements solutions, an analyst agent validates results. This pattern mirrors how human teams operate, with each agent fine-tuned for specific capabilities rather than being a jack-of-all-trades.", "score": 0.8687491, "raw_content": null, "summary": "7 Agentic AI Trends to Watch in 2026 Image by Author The agentic AI field is moving from experimental prototypes to production-ready autonomous systems.

It is clear that as AI becomes more embedded in the industry, trust and accountability will be just as important as innovation. That's the future that Veracity is helping us to shape. Thanks to our audience for joining us on Veracity AI talks. I'm Tom Erik Sjønnland.
