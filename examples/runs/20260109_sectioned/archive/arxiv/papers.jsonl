Identifying such individuals is not always possible beforehand, as they provide only right-censored data. Ignoring the presence of the cured group can introduce bias in the final model. This paper presents a method for estimating a semiparametric additive hazards model that accounts for the cured fraction. Unlike regression coefficients in a hazard ratio model, those in an additive hazard model measure hazard differences. The proposed method uses a primal-dual interior point algorithm to obtain constrained maximum penalized likelihood estimates of the model parameters, including the regression coefficients and the baseline hazard, subject to certain non-negativity constraints.", "primary_category": "stat.ME", "categories": ["stat.ME"], "doi": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01234v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01234v1"}
