## Section: AI trends for 2026 (agentic AI, physical AI)
- **Agentic AI, physical AI, and sovereign AI** are repeatedly framed as the “next” set of forces moving AI from single-task assistance toward *systems that take responsibility, touch real-world operations, and face stricter constraints around control/compliance*. HealthVerity explicitly groups these three as signals of AI “taking on more responsibility,” moving “closer to real-world operations,” and operating under “stricter expectations for transparency, control and compliance.” It also highlights *pilots moving into production* and rising needs for *accountability/oversight* and new operational roles for monitoring/governance.

- **Scaling from pilots to production + governance focus** are recurring “early predictions.” Deloitte’s post explicitly lists “Scaling pilots to production” and “Increased focus on governance and compliance” as early predictions for 2026 in the context of agentic AI/physical AI/sovereign AI.

- **A contrarian/hype-cycle framing appears in management commentary**: MIT Sloan Management Review predicts continued progression toward value from agentic AI “despite the hype,” and suggests agents may enter a “trough of disillusionment” in 2026 (in parallel with generative AI’s hype cycle).

- **Popular press predictions emphasize manufacturing/robotics and “physical AI.”** Forbes associates “physical AI” with humanoid robots moving from demos to targeted commercial pilots, and also claims agentic AI will run logistics/production end-to-end (presented as forward-looking predictions rather than validated outcomes).

## Section: youtube / github / agentic AI demos open source code / industrial AI deployment talks

### Agentic AI demos open source code (GitHub + YouTube)
- **GitHub topic signal:** the `agentic-ai` topic page highlights an ecosystem of agent frameworks, observability/evaluation tooling, local “autonomous agent” projects, and MCP-related utilities. Examples surfaced directly on the topic page include `google/adk-python` (agent toolkit), `raga-ai-hub/RagaAI-Catalyst` (observability/monitoring/evaluation), `Fosowl/agenticSeek` (local autonomous agent), and others.  
  Source: GitHub Topics “agentic-ai” https://github.com/topics/agentic-ai [archive/tavily_search.jsonl]
- **Example “demos/apps” repo:** Red Hat’s `agentic-examples` repo positions itself as deployable “Agentic AI Apps & Demos,” and calls out enabling mechanisms like *function calling* and *Model Context Protocol (MCP)*, plus example frameworks (Llama Stack, LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.).  
  Source: GitHub repo `rh-aiservices-bu/agentic-examples` https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/agentic-examples [archive/tavily_search.jsonl]
- **Pattern catalog signal:** `nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns` frames itself as a curated catalogue of “agentic AI patterns,” with emphasis on workflow/UX/human-in-the-loop and collaboration patterns (e.g., “Human-in-the-Loop Approval Framework”).

- **YouTube demos (no transcripts available in this run; summary derived from metadata/descriptions):**
  - SambaNova demo: LangGraph “agentic GraphRAG workflows” over EHRs using tools that generate/execute Cypher queries against Neo4j; highlights multi-turn conversations and on-prem deployment positioning.

  - “Agentic coding” model review/demo: GLM-4.7 open-source model focused on tool use/terminal workflows, benchmark discussion (SWE-bench, Terminal Bench, etc.).  
    Source: YouTube (Universe of AI) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ua4mszi_ss [archive/youtube/videos.jsonl]
  - Open-source “Auto Claude” tooling demo that links to a GitHub repo and discusses workflow features (kanban/task management, terminals, context/memory, GitHub integration) per description.

### Industrial AI deployment talks (YouTube)
- **Responsible deployment / assurance theme:** DNV’s “Veracity AI Talks” episode description emphasizes trusted data as a foundation, “AI assurance,” accountability across industrial value chains, synthetic data for high-risk events, and regulation vs innovation.  
  Source: YouTube (DNV) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19eqfht1A68 [archive/tavily_search.jsonl]
- **Edge + low-connectivity operations theme:** AWS re:Invent 2025 “Implement Agentic AI at the edge…” describes deploying small vision-language models and agents via AWS Outposts and “Strands Agents” for on-prem/site operations, multilingual interaction, and safety protocol/documentation assistance.  
  Source: YouTube (AWS) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln-Iu1o7TME [archive/tavily_search.jsonl]
- **Industrial AI “operating system” + digital twin theme:** Siemens CES 2026 keynote positions “Industrial AI” as a force for industry, highlights Siemens–NVIDIA work on an “Industrial AI Operating System,” and introduces “Digital Twin Composer” (mid-2026 availability claimed in the video description), plus “Industrial Copilots” bridging IT/OT.  
  Source: YouTube (Siemens) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Wm6YdoZSs [archive/tavily_search.jsonl; archive/youtube/videos.jsonl]
