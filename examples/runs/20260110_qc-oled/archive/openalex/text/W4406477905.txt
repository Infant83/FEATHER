Abstract 
Researchers in condensed matter physics are currently exploring new materials for specific use in various applications. 
The peculiar properties of quantum materials (QMs) have garnered significant attention because they have the poten-
tial to serve as building blocks for entirely new technologies in modern science and technology. QMs exhibit emerg-
ing phenomena governed by quantum confinement, strong electronic correlations, topology, and symmetry, making 
them exceptional materials. This review paper provides an overview of these unique properties, different types 
of QMs, and their applications with the latest case studies, presenting a prospective outlook on QMs in multiple 
domains.

Introduction
The twentieth century witnessed remarkable progress 
in Physics, significantly enhancing our understanding 
of sub-atomic and sub-nuclear phenomena. Concur-
rently, advancements in technology played a pivotal role 
in driving global development. Most of our quality-of-life 
improvements over the past half-century can be attrib-
uted to semiconductor-based electronics. Many technol-
ogies crucial to modern life, including communication, 
computing, sensing, and measurement, have been rede-
signed to align with the rules of quantum mechanics. In 
the last two decades, academia and industry have made 
substantial investments in researching these technolo-
gies, with some already progressing beyond the proto-
type stage. For instance, photonic, superconducting, and 
atom-based quantum technologies have demonstrated 
superiority over their classical counterparts. Recent 
advances in the quantum physics of materials have led 
to a profound shift in perspective. While scientists and 
engineers have long utilized quantum effects in electronic 
devices, such as optoelectronics and hard-disk drives, the 
past decade has revealed how subtle quantum phenom-
ena govern the macroscopic behaviour of various materi-
als (Wang et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2018). Quantum materials 
(QMs) are particularly crucial in the field of quantum 
computation (Zunger and Malyi  2021). Numerous sci-
entists believe that QMs hold the potential to bring 
about a revolution in various domains, including highly 
efficient and low-data communication, data storage 
(Marković and Grollier 2020; Wendin 2016) energy har-
vesting, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence (AI) 
(Schuller et al. 2022; Tokura et al. 2017). In the future, AI 
will play a vital role in performing and analysing numer-
ous calculations like human brain networks and topol-
ogy (Head-Marsden et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Shao 
et al. 2021). To train an artificial brain network, artificial 
synapses should match the biological data processing 
characteristics which show dynamic behaviour toward 
signal response. QMs attracted the research community 
due to their highly controllable electronic structure and

non-linear performances. Hence, QMs are a developing 
area for intelligent society (Dai et  al.  2019; Wang et  al. 
2022).
A material whose properties cannot be fully described 
by the classical behaviour of materials and whose proper-
ties originate from novel quantum effects are described 
as QMs (Lau et  al.  2020; Samarth 2017). In classical 
materials, the physical performance of the material can 
be explained by particle interaction. For example, ion 
motion can be classically explained by electrostatic inter-
actions (Cava et al. 2021). However, a quantum mechan-
ics approach can only provide a complete explanation as 
classical theory cannot explain many effects that arise in 
QMs, such as quantum fluctuation and spin entangle-
ments (Fürst et al. 2014). Complicated electronic states in 
QMs originate from the interactions of the degree of free-
dom (lattice, charge, orbital, and spin (Basov et al. 2017). 
The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in 
copper oxides (1986) initiated a significant expansion in 
QMs research, revealing that macroscopic quantum phe-
nomena could exist beyond extreme conditions (Bednorz 
and Müller 1986). This breakthrough prompted extensive 
exploration into the influence of Coulomb interactions 
on conduction electrons, leading to the investigation of 
diverse materials. QMs contain novel entanglement or 
topological properties, i.e. materials with entanglement 
beyond the requirement of Fermi statistics and with top-
ological responses (Keimer and Moore 2017). Phenom-
ena like quantized vortices in superconductors provide 
evidence the topological nature of quantum wavefunc-
tions is described by quantized vortices in superconduc-
tors (Thouless et  al. 2012). These vortices arise due to 
the necessity of a well-defined phase in the supercon-
ducting condensate, with the phase’s coupling to mag-
netic flux governed by gauge invariance (Thouless et al. 
2012). Topological invariants, such as the integer winding 
number dictating the phase’s winding around vortices, 
remain fixed under smooth system changes, impacting 
various materials beyond superconductors and facilitat-
ing phenomena like dissipation less transport (Benyamini 
et  al.  2019) and unique quasiparticle excitations (Saeed 
et al. 2023). Secondly, the non-local entanglement inher-
ent in specific quantum states has been emphasized, 
notably in experiments displaying teleportation with 
widely separated photons (Kusne et al. 2021). Non-local 
entanglement, which highlights the inter-connectedness 
of quantum states, even within large systems of electrons, 
offers us a new frontier for technological advancements 
and fundamental physics (Horodecki et  al.  2009; Zycz-
kowski et al. 2001). Entanglement happens in even simple 
materials, like metals, where the wave functions of many 
electrons become very closely linked because electrons 
are fermionic. Understanding these quantum phenomena 
is a scientific pursuit and a pathway to practical applica-
tions and innovation. Examples of QMs include hydrogen 
sulfide, transitioning from a foul-smelling gas to a super-
conductor with record-setting transition temperatures 
exceeding 200  K under high pressure (Drozdov et  al. 
2015), and diamonds, where the entanglement of elec-
tronic and nuclear spins at defect centres enables long-
lasting quantum coherence even at room temperature, 
offering promising prospects for quantum technologies 
(Balasubramanian, et al. 2009; Maurer, et al. 1979).
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2023 recognizes the 
innovative discovery and advancement of quantum dots 
(QDs) (“Nobel Prize - Chemistry, Discoveries, Innova-
tions | Britannica”. 2024). Usually, an element’s proper-
ties are dictated by its number of electrons. Still, when 
the matter is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, quantum 
phenomena come into play, governed by size rather than 
electron count. Ekimov discovered the semiconductor 
nanocrystals known as QDs in 1981 and explored size-
dependent quantum effects in nanoparticles using copper 
chloride nanoparticles (Ekimov et  al.  1985). Louis Brus 
further advanced the field by proving size-dependent 
quantum effects in freely suspended particles a few years 
later. In 1993, Moungi Bawendi’s contributions produced 
almost perfect QDs, a crucial step for their practical 
applications (Murray et  al.  1993). Today, QDs illumi-
nate screens in QLED technology, enhance the lighting 
of LED lamps, and aid biochemists and doctors in tissue 
mapping. These tiny particles hold immense promise, 
potentially impacting flexible electronics, miniature sen-
sors, thinner solar cells, medical surgery, biological map-
ping, and encrypted quantum communication, signifying 
just the beginning of their transformative potential.
Over the past years, the Nobel Prize has been awarded 
in the field of the quantum domain, signing a rapid and 
transformative evolution in this domain. QMs play a 
crucial role in driving advancements in quantum tech-
nology, highlighting their significance in shaping the 
future of this field. Figure 1 express the past, current, and 
future trends of research in very brief. QMs have gained 
substantial attention in materials science, yet the lit-
erature lacks comprehensive reviews due to their recent 
emergence in various applications. Our paper focuses 
on introducing QMs, unique properties (quantum con-
finement, strong electronic correlations, topology, and 
symmetry), and different applications. This paper is a val-
uable resource for researchers, scientists, and engineers 
looking to better understand QMs and their applications.
Unique properties of QMs
The term “Quantum Materials” is relatively new in the 
scientific community, leading to some confusion despite 
these materials being studied for a while. Research in this

area is rapidly expanding, driven by the need for detailed 
consideration of electron wave functions and their sur-
roundings. By Robert Cava, “I will not endeavour to pro-
vide a precise definition of what a quantum material is, 
but I know one when I see it.” (Cava et al. 2021). Examples 
of QMs that you may generally be familiar with are those 
that display the quantum hall effect or superconductiv-
ity, TIs, spin liquids, qubits, quantum sensors, or QDs. 
Interactions of fundamental degrees of freedom—lattice, 
charge, orbital, and spin—result in complex electronic 
states on the atomic scale. In this section, we will briefly 
discuss the fundamental properties of QMs—quantum 
confinement, strong electronic correlations, topology, 
and symmetry.
Quantum confinement
It is a fundamental phenomenon in nanoscale materi-
als, particularly semiconductors and other confined sys-
tems. It refers to the effect of restricting the motion of 
electrons and other quantum particles within a region 
smaller than their characteristic wavelength. We use 
quantum mechanics to describe particles like electrons 
as discrete particles and waves with associated wave-
lengths. A particle’s de Broglie wavelength (λ) is inversely 
proportional to its momentum (p). As the size of a con-
fined region becomes comparable to or smaller than the 
de Broglie wavelength of particles, their wave-like behav-
iour becomes significant. In bulk materials, electrons 
have continuous energy bands due to the large number 
of atoms. However, in nanoscale materials, the confined 
dimensions impose boundary conditions that limit elec-
trons’ possible standing wave patterns (orbitals). This 
leads to the quantization of energy levels, where only 
specific energy values are allowed. The energy levels 
become discrete, resembling the rungs of a ladder rather 
than a continuous slope. The bandgap of a material is the 
energy difference between the highest energy electron in 
the valence band and the lowest energy electron in the 
conduction band. In bulk materials, the bandgap remains 
relatively constant. In nanostructures, especially semi-
conductor nanoparticles or QDs, the bandgap increases 
with decreasing particle size due to quantum confine-
ment. (Ramalingam et al. 2020; Ramalingam et al. n.d.). 
This is shown pictorially in Fig. 2. This means the elec-
tronic transitions responsible for optical properties occur 
at higher energies (shorter wavelengths) than in bulk 
materials.
To learn more about quantum confinement, we need 
to know about QDs. It is now possible to see quantum 
confinement effects in a new type of material called 
QDs. QDs are nanometer-sized semiconductor crys-
tals, and molecules comprise tightly packed electrons or 
pairs of electrons and holes called ‘excitons’ (Mueller and 
Malic 2018). When an electron is excited into a higher 
energy state, either through absorption of a photon or by 
another excitation method such as electroluminescence, 
this creates a positively charged space at the lower energy 
level, known as a hole. This results in the formation of the

electron–hole pair. These two particles sometimes exist 
in a bound state, forming a single quasi-particle known 
as an “exciton” (Mueller and Malic 2018). Within an exci-
ton, the electron and the hole pair are bound together by 
coulombic interaction, and this strength of the bond is 
quantified by its exciton binding energy.
Excitons have an average physical separation between 
the electron and the hole pair, referred to as the exci-
ton Bohr radius. Every semiconductor material has a

characteristic exciton Bohr radius; depending on this, 
we classify them into Frenkel and Wannier excitons 
(Shiau and Combescot 2023). Frenkel: has a tightly 
bound radius of a similar magnitude as the unit cell, and 
Wannier: has a large radius exceeding the size of the 
unit cell. While the de Broglie wavelength is very small 
compared to the size of the limiting structure, the parti-
cle acts like it is free. The energy states stay the same at 
this stage, and the bandgap returns to its original place. 
Another energy spectrum does not stay continuous; it 
breaks up into discrete waves as the size of the confining 
object shrinks to the nanoscale, as represented in Fig. 2. 
So, the bandgap has properties that rely on particle size, 
which eventually leads to a blue shift in the light emit-
ted as the particle size decreases. However, this result 
shows what happens when you keep the electrons and 
electron–hole pair (also called excitons) in a space close 
to the critical quantum limit, known as the Bohr exciton 
radius (Zhang et al. 2022). We can classify it into three 
regimes based on the exciton Bohr radius. Weak con-
finement regime: the radius of the crystallite is greater 
than the exciton Bohr radius. Moderate confinement 
regime: the radius of the crystallite is comparable to the 
exciton radius. Strong confinement regime: the radius 
of the crystallite is smaller than the Bohr exciton radius 
(Ramalingam et al. 2020). The band gap (Eg) increases in 
magnitude (increase in energy of the band-to-band exci-
tation peaks (blue shift)) as the semiconductor particle 
radius decreases in size to the point when it becomes 
comparable or smaller than that of the exciton radius as 
shown in Fig. 2. This property has led to various fields: 
semiconducting quantum wells and superlattice devices, 
non-linear optical materials, photocatalysis, and imaging 
systems (Brus 1984).
Depending on the confinement dimension, we can clas-
sify confinement as shown in Fig. 2. Electrons confined in 
one direction, i.e., quantum wires: electrons can quickly 
move in one dimension (1D), quantum wells (thin films): 
electrons can promptly move in two dimensions (2D), so 
two dimensions are quantized. Figure  2a is a represen-
tation of the confinement of QMs, their corresponding 
energy levels, and a schematic example of broken sym-
metry and the functional form of the density of states in 
one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-
dimensional (3D) confined QMs. Where ECB energy of 
the conduction band, EVB is the energy of the valence 
band, ρ density of states, and n is the number of state 
per unit space. Figure 2b demonstrates that when parti-
cle size decreases and reaches the nanoscale, it decreases 
in confining dimension and makes energy levels discrete, 
and this increases the band gap and also increases in 
band gap energy (Edvinsson 2018).
Quantum confinement significantly affects the absorp-
tion and emission of light in nanoscale materials. As 
the energy levels are quantized, the energy difference 
between electronic transitions becomes more significant, 
resulting in more energetic absorption and emission 
peaks. This can lead to enhanced fluorescence, lumines-
cence, and colour tunability of nanomaterials, which have 
applications in displays, lasers, and biological imaging.
In bulk materials, the conductivity is mainly deter-
mined by the concentration of free charge carriers 
(electrons or holes). In quantum-confined systems, the 
discrete energy levels create an energy gap between the 
highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states. This can 
hinder the movement of charge carriers and reduce the 
conductivity. However, quantum tunnelling becomes 
more prominent at specific energy levels, allowing carri-
ers to pass through energy barriers and leading to excit-
ing conductivity behaviours. Quantum tunnelling is a 
phenomenon in which particles can penetrate a poten-
tial energy barrier that is higher than the particle’s total 
energy. This occurs due to the wave-like nature of par-
ticles described by quantum mechanics, where the par-
ticle’s wave function can extend into the barrier region 
and allow a finite probability of the particle appearing 
on the other side. The probability of tunnelling depends 
exponentially on the barrier width and height, as well as 
the particle’s energy. This type of motion is not allowed 
by the laws of classical dynamics (Mohsen Razavy et al. 
n.d). Quantum tunnelling is important in many physical 
operation of semiconductor devices like tunnel diodes 
(“Tunnel Diode - GeeksforGeeks”. 2024) and scanning 
tunnelling microscopes (Anirban 2022).
Quantum confinement is crucial in the development of 
nanoscale electronic devices. QDs can be used as single-
electron transistors (Kiyama, et al. 2018), quantum bits 
(qubits) (Zhang et al. 2018) in quantum computing due 
to their discrete energy levels and controllable charg-
ing behaviour, in bioimaging (Abdellatif et al. 1951) due 
to higher brightness, photostability, and ability to made 
water-dispersible, in photovoltaic devices (Cotta  2020) 
due to tuneable absorption and high excitation coefficient 
and in other applications like quantum dot light-emitting 
diode (QLEDs), sensing application, laser, and beyond 
due to their characteristics properties (Bera et al. 2010).
Strong electronic correlation
QMs exhibit unique electronic, magnetic, and opti-
cal properties from quantum mechanical effects at the 
atomic and subatomic levels. Strong correlation effects 
in QMs are a fascinating and intricate aspect that plays 
a crucial role in determining their behaviour. These 
correlation effects emerge due to the strong interac-
tions between electrons within the material, leading to 


===== PAGE 6 =====

Goyal et al. J Mater. Sci: Mater Eng.            (2025) 20:4 
non-trivial behaviours that cannot be understood using 
classical physics alone. Electrons in classical materi-
als frequently function as self-sufficient individuals, but 
in quantum QMs, significant interactions predominate 
due to factors such as Coulomb repulsion. This complex 
interaction results in emergent behaviours that devi-
ate significantly from traditional classical expectations. 
High-temperature superconductivity, seen in certain 
QMs, is one notable example in which electron pairs 
termed Cooper pairs travel coherently along the lattice, 
resulting in zero electrical resistance (Holten et al. 2022). 
This phenomenon defies conventional wisdom and can 
transform power transmission and energy storage tech-
nology (Bednorz et al. 1986). To understand strong cor-
relation better, we will delve into the strong correlation 
properties of QMs and their significance in various phys-
ical phenomena.
In metals like copper and aluminium, mobile electrons 
interact slightly due to Coulomb forces but are largely 
unaffected by them due to their high kinetic energy. 
This allows for a perturbative approach based on single-
electron theories. However, traditional theories struggle 
when Coulomb interactions become comparable to or 
exceed the kinetic energy, as in strongly correlated sys-
tems (Si et al. 2001). These materials offer fertile ground 
for discovering new physics, especially near zero-tem-
perature phase transitions, where quantum critical fluc-
tuations can lead to exotic excitations and novel quantum 
phases. Strongly correlated electron systems have driven 
significant theoretical advancements, including highly 
entangled phases of matter and quantum critical points 
that extend beyond conventional frameworks like Lan-
dau’s theory (Wen 2017).
In QMs, electrons are the charge carriers, and the prin-
ciples of quantum mechanics govern their behaviour 
(Morosan et al. 2012). When electrons interact strongly 
with each other, their collective behaviour can deviate 
significantly from that predicted by simple models. This 
interaction gives rise to various quantum phases, such 
as Mott insulators (Mila 2024), correlated metals (Zhang 
et  al. 2016), and high-temperature superconductors 
(Zhou et al. 2021). Many materials’ electrical, magnetic, 
optical, and mechanical properties depend on electron–
electron interactions. Hund’s rules in transition metals 
illustrate that Coulomb energy savings make d electron 
spin alignment and spatial orbital living profitable. Based 
on electron–electron repulsion and quantum physics, 
these and related exchange interactions underpin mag-
netic order, which is essential in industry and physics. 
The complicated interaction between electron–electron 
interactions, lattice structure, kinetic energy (via elec-
tron quantum–mechanical tunnelling in crystals), and 
magnetic degrees of freedom is noteworthy. Ground 
states with differing symmetries and low energy excita-
tions compete, as do ‘local’ quantum degrees of freedom 
associated with lattice sites and longer-scale fluctuations 
and excitations. When an electronic population or mag-
netic field tilts the energy scale balance, new phases often 
develop at quantum phase transitions. These phases can 
have surprising and useful properties like high-temper-
ature superconductivity. Technologically relevant fea-
tures include orders-of-magnitude electrical conductivity 
shifts (metal–insulator transitions), perhaps modified by 
a magnetic field (‘colossal magnetoresistance’). Strong 
correlations can function as a lever arm at certain behav-
iour cusps, making modest controllable factor changes 
affect material attributes. Strong electron correlations 
enable complicated electrical material properties but 
make examination difficult. Well-developed perturbative 
approaches like expansion, local density Hartree–Fock 
approximations, Thomas–Fermi screening in metals, and 
others allow us to understand the electronic behaviour of 
relatively modest electron–electron repulsion compared 
to kinetic energy. Controlled theoretical techniques are 
limited when interactions are high, as in d and f electron 
systems. The problem is open except for 1D systems with 
analytical and computational methods. The ‘renormaliza-
tion group’ paradigm and Landau’s adiabaticity principle 
save the day.
Figure 3 illustrates various materials housing strongly 
correlated electrons, including cuprate high-temperature 
superconductors (Keimer et  al. 2015), ruthenates, tran-
sition metal oxides (Tokura and Nagaosa 1979), heavy 
fermion systems (Si and Steglich 1979), iron-based super-
conductors (Si et  al. 2016), organics (Oike et  al.  2015), 
and low-dimensional materials (Cao et  al.  2018). These 
systems primarily involve d or f orbitals, which maintain 
some localization within the solid, resulting in height-
ened Coulomb interaction and narrower bandwidths 
compared to s or p orbitals. Furthermore, these orbitals 
generate localized moments within the materials under 
specific filling conditions. Figure  3 describes the func-
tionality of strongly correlated materials by illustrating 
selected classes of such materials and how interactions 
between their low-energy degrees of freedom, often 
referred to as ‘building blocks’ and symmetry, can give 
rise to various functionalities like superconductivity, etc.
The Mott transition is a classic example of a strong cor-
relation in materials. It is characterized by a phase transi-
tion from a metal to an insulator due to strong electron 
correlations. This transition is often associated with a 
marked change in the electronic structure, such as the 
transition from long to short c-axis layered perovskite 
structures. Factors like changes in orbital order drive the 
Mott transition and can occur together with structural 
transformations (Wang et  al.  2019). This phenomenon

is a collective manifestation of the imbalance in the par-
ticle-wave duality of electrons. It is considered a quan-
tum critical transition in many materials, showcasing 
the intricate interplay between electron interactions and 
material properties (Furukawa et al. 2014).
Another remarkable manifestation of a strong cor-
relation is high-temperature superconductivity. These 
materials can conduct electricity without resistance at 
temperatures significantly higher than traditional super-
conductors (“Superconductivity - High Temp, Magnetic 
Fields, Condensed Matter | Britannica”. 2024). In conven-
tional superconductors, electron–phonon interactions 
pair electrons and allow them to flow without resistance. 
However, electron–electron solid interactions in high-
temperature superconductors are thought to play a cru-
cial role in enabling superconductivity at temperatures 
much higher than conventional theories predict (Sun 
et al. 2021). Understanding and controlling these corre-
lations are critical challenges in condensed matter phys-
ics. The discovery of high-temperature superconductors, 
such as copper oxide materials, has revolutionized the 
field of superconductivity, offering the potential for prac-
tical applications in various industries. High-temperature 
superconductivity challenges conventional theories of 
superconductivity and highlights the complex interplay 
of electron interactions in these materials, showcasing 
a strong correlation between electronic properties and 
superconducting behaviour (Orenstein and Millis 1979).
Quantum phase transitions occur at absolute zero tem-
perature, representing a unique phenomenon in quantum 
systems (“Quantum Phase Transitions - Rosenbaum Lab”. 
2024). These transitions are characterized by changes in 
the ground state of a system as specific parameters in 
its Hamiltonian are varied, leading to distinct phases at 
absolute zero temperature. Strong correlations can drive 
quantum phase transitions between ordered or disor-
dered states. Unlike classical phase transitions driven 
by thermal fluctuations, quantum phase transitions at 
absolute zero are governed by quantum fluctuations and 
the interplay of quantum correlations. These transitions 
are exciting due to the novel and deep properties in the 
quantum critical region, offering insights into various 
behaviours in condensed-matter systems. The study of 
quantum phase transitions provides valuable information 
about the fundamental nature of quantum systems and 
their behaviour at the quantum critical point.
The lattice structure of a material indeed plays a cru-
cial role in the emergence of strong correlation effects 
in quantum mechanical systems. The arrangement of 
atoms in a lattice influences the effective interactions 
between electrons, affecting their movement and inter-
actions within the material. This connection between the 
electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is fundamental 
in understanding the behaviour of quantum mechani-
cal systems, especially in strongly correlated electron 
systems where the interplay between electron–elec-
tron interactions and lattice dynamics is intricate. The

lattice structure can modify the electronic properties of 
a material, leading to phenomena like high-temperature 
superconductivity or Mott transitions, highlighting the 
significance of considering both electronic and lattice 
aspects when studying strongly correlated quantum sys-
tems (Izsák et al. 2023; Tokura et al. 2017).
Describing and predicting the behaviour of strongly 
correlated quantum mechanical systems pose a sig-
nificant theoretical challenge due to the intricate inter-
play between different degrees of freedom. Traditional 
mean-field approximations often need to catch up in 
capturing the complexities of these systems. Advanced 
techniques such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) 
(Qu et  al. 2022), density matrix renormalization group 
(DMRG) (Verstraete et  al. 2023), and tensor network 
methods (Orús 2019) are employed to address these 
challenges. These methods offer more sophisticated 
approaches to model and understanding the behaviour 
of strongly correlated quantum systems by considering 
the dynamic nature of electron correlations and interac-
tions. Techniques like DMFT focus on the local behav-
iour of electrons, providing insights into the effects of 
strong correlations on electronic properties. DMRG, 
on the other hand, is particularly useful for 1D systems, 
offering a powerful numerical method to study quan-
tum many-body systems. Tensor network methods pro-
vide a framework to represent quantum states efficiently, 
enabling the study of entanglement and correlations in 
strongly correlated systems. By utilizing these advanced 
techniques, researchers can delve deeper into the com-
plexities of strongly correlated quantum systems and gain 
a more comprehensive understanding of their behav-
iour and properties (Vollhardt 2019; Tsuchimochi and 
Scuseria 2009).
Topology and symmetry in QMs
Figure 4 shows the topology and band inversion in insu-
lators. Atomic limit energy levels determine the natural 
order of occupied (blue line) and unoccupied (yellow line) 
orbitals (Fig. 4a). As the lattice parameter (a) lowers, the 
gap between the occupied and unoccupied Bloch states 
closes at a critical point and reopens inverted concern-
ing the atomic order, achieving a topological state. Semi-
metal topological state classification (Fig. 4b). Materials 
can be bulk band inverted to create topological semimet-
als. Crystalline rotational or mirror symmetry protects 
the inverted valence and conduction band crossings 
(left). Dirac semimetals have fourfold degenerate cross-
ing points shielded by rotational symmetry in the pres-
ence of inversion (P) and time-reversal (Θ) symmetries. 
Weyl semimetals have twofold degenerate band crossings 
that form chiral Weyl fermions separated in momentum 
space. The distance between oppositely charged Weyl 
nodes protects the phase. Kramers–Weyl fermions and 
non-symmorphic semimetals generate topological semi-
metals without bulk band inversion. Non-symmorphic 
crystal symmetries protect spin–orbit coupling band 
crossings. Degeneracies and energy–momentum rela-
tionships near band touching points classify topological 
semimetals (Singh et al. 2023).
Condensed matter physics, focusing on particle sys-
tems’ motion patterns and laws, has emerged as a vital 
subdiscipline. The discovery of the integer quantum 
Hall effect (IQHE) in 1980 (Lv et  al.  2021), alongside 
subsequent findings of various topological quantum 
states, has unlocked a realm for global scientists. Topol-
ogy and symmetry play crucial roles in QMs by influ-
encing their properties and behaviour. In the realm of 
QMs, topology refers to the study of properties that 
remain unchanged under continuous deformations,

like stretching or bending, without tearing or gluing. 
On the other hand, symmetry involves operations that 
leave a system invariant, such as spatial isotropy, trans-
lations, time reversal, and various internal quantum 
numbers. Topology and symmetry are fundamental 
concepts in QMs, influencing their phases, properties, 
and behaviour by defining symmetries, order param-
eters, and the structural characteristics that underpin 
their unique quantum phenomena. It is challenging to 
summarize everything here, but we will briefly discuss 
the main things here.
Topology is a mathematical idea that ignores small 
details and gradual changes. Think of a doughnut with 
a hole—the number of holes is a topological feature that 
tells us about its shape in space. This applies to materi-
als, too, like how atoms are arranged in crystals or how 
electrons behave (Po et al. 2017). These special materials, 
called topological QMs, have unique qualities because of 
their topological structure. The discovery of the integer 
and fractional quantum Hall effects (IQHE and FQHE) 
has unveiled a unique form of matter known as the 
topological quantum state. Investigating the topologi-
cal characteristics of these materials involves identify-
ing similar properties in electronic band structures and 
physical quantities, leading to physical states less affected 
by material defects. (Hasan and Kane 2010; Nayak et al. 
2008).
The ‘topology of states’ refers to how electron states 
are organized in a material, understood through unique 
numbers called ‘topological invariants.’ These numbers 
describe the shape of electron wavefunctions in momen-
tum space (Song et al. 2018). A material with a ‘non-triv-
ial topological number’ has unique electron wavefunction 
shapes, guaranteeing special surface or edge states that 
are resilient to small changes in the material. An analogy 
is the unchanging basic shape of an object under gentle 
deformations. The appearance of these particular states 
in a material indicates a unique shape in its electron 
wavefunctions, as seen in the quantum Hall state (QHS), 
where the bulk becomes electrically insulating under a 
strong magnetic field in a 2D material. In contrast, chiral 
conducting states form along its edges. These edge states 
persist despite attempts to eliminate them, making QHS 
a precise standard for resistance and determining funda-
mental constants like the fine structure constant.
The band theory paradigm, a framework used in phys-
ics, has been used in predicting new topological materials 
and confirming their unique properties through experi-
ments involving spectroscopy and transport. This analy-
ses band structures and topological invariants derived 
from topology and crystalline symmetry considerations. 
Recent advancements in band theory, which integrate 
topology and crystalline symmetries, have enabled a 
comprehensive classification of topological states. For 
instance, insulating non-magnetic materials encompass-
ing 230 space groups have been identified to support 
around 3000 different options (Po et al. 2017).
Topology serves as a keyway to organize and under-
stand quantum states. It is all about the shape of the elec-
tronic wave function and how it behaves in k space, which 
is a mathematical representation of momentum space. 
The specific shape depends on the symmetry group of 
the crystal lattice. These topological characteristics con-
trol how materials respond to environmental changes 
and stay consistent even when the material’s properties 
change smoothly. Imagine a scenario where the order of 
electron energy levels switches at specific points near the 
Fermi level. This change in order is like a band inversion, 
leading to a topologically nontrivial state.
Three main methods are commonly used to determine 
the unique properties of materials: (1) directly calculat-
ing specific characteristics that indicate their topological 
nature and symmetry indicators (Soluyanov and Vander-
bilt 2011; Bradlyn, et al. 2017), (2) employing a gradual 
transition to link the topological state of an unfamiliar 
material with that of a known one (Lin, et al. 2013), and 
(3) utilizing the relationship between bulk and surface 
states to identify the nontrivial properties of materials 
(Essin and Gurarie 2011). The first two methods involve 
analysing the symmetry properties of bulk states, often 
represented in their irreducible forms at specific points in 
the Brillouin zone. Initially conceived as a parity criterion 
for materials with inversion symmetry, this method was 
expanded to cover all types of space groups. The third 
method reveals the unique states of materials by exam-
ining their connections with bulk bands, offering experi-
mental clues to confirm their distinctive properties.
Insulators are materials that do not conduct electricity, 
and they have a primary state where they are electrically 
inactive due to an energy gap between their filled and 
empty states. TIs are a newer insulator type with a gap 
in their bulk but can still conduct electricity along their 
surface because of unique metallic states caused by the 
arrangement of their bulk states. We can understand this 
by examining the material’s structure with and without 
specific effects. If we remove a particular effect called 
spin–orbit coupling (SOC) (Fu et al. 2007; Bernevig and 
Zhang 2006), the material behaves like a regular insula-
tor or a metal. But if we gradually introduce SOC, we 
observe a change from a regular state to a particular state 
where the gap in energy closes at a critical point, mark-
ing a transition. The nature of the material remains the 
same as long as its bulk properties stay intact. The sur-
faces of these materials act like a boundary between the 
unique interior and the regular outside, and this bound-
ary results in unique surface states that connect the filled

and empty states within the material. TIs are character-
ized by a property called Z2, which can be either 0 or 1, 
indicating whether they are ordinary or extraordinary. 
This property can be calculated by analysing the behav-
iour of electronic states within the material. These unique 
properties also affect the behaviour of surface states, 
which have interesting features like linear energy patterns 
and a specific spin alignment that make them resistant to 
certain disruptions.
Topological states in semimetals are special because of 
their unique band structures close to the Fermi energy, 
which have distinct topological properties. These states 
are grouped based on their nodal band structures and 
surface states, with types such as Dirac, Weyl, or line–
node semimetals identified by their node dispersion and 
the symmetries that protect these characteristics (Velury 
and Hughes 2022; Schoop et  al.  2018). In semimetals, 
these topological band crossings can either happen acci-
dentally, like Dirac points and lines, which are preserved 
by specific crystal symmetries and remain stable under 
small changes, or they can be enforced by symmetry, aris-
ing from non-symmorphic symmetries and remaining 
stable even with significant deformations of the system. 
These topological states are crucial for various material 
properties and applications, showcasing unusual trans-
port behaviours, durable surface states, and distinctive 
responses to electromagnetic fields. These topological 
semimetals, like Dirac and Weyl semimetals, have been 
supported by theoretical predictions from first-principles 
calculations (Lv et al. 2021), emphasizing the importance 
of understanding and exploring these materials for future 
technological progress.
One of the defining features of topological states is 
their remarkable robustness against local perturbations 
and disorder (Zhang et al. 2021). This robustness arises 
from the nontrivial topology of the electronic wavefunc-
tions. The disorder can scatter electrons and degrade 
their behaviour in conventional materials, leading to 
effects like resistivity in electronic systems. As high-
lighted in the provided sources, this property is a piv-
otal advantage of topological systems, showcasing the 
absence of electronic backscattering in phenomena like 
the quantum Hall effect and spin-Hall effect. Topological 
states exhibit unidirectional waveguiding and edge states 
that persist despite imperfections or impurities, making 
them highly resilient to small perturbations and fabrica-
tion flaws. This robustness against disorder and defects 
allows for efficient energy and information routing in 
various 2D platforms, ranging from quantum electron-
ics to classical photonic and phononic devices, offering 
significant application potential across different fields of 
research and technology.
In the study of TIs, specific key terms are vital to 
understand. TIs often have an ‘energy gap,’ a range of 
energy levels where electrons cannot exist. This gap is 
crucial for stability, preventing unwanted energy fluc-
tuations that could cause data loss (Wang et al. 2023). 
Another important aspect is the emergence of ‘edge 
states’ along boundaries like edges or surfaces. These 
states are localized and conduct electricity without 
scattering. This protection allows for robust infor-
mation transfer and transport, even in impurities or 
defects (Yurkevich and Kagalovsky 2021).
The quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a remarkable dis-
covery in physics where, in 2D electronic systems, the 
Hall resistance is quantized in integer multiples of a 
fundamental constant (Klitzing et  al.  1980). This phe-
nomenon arises from the unique topological char-
acteristics of the system, resulting in the precise 
quantization of the Hall conductivity despite any disor-
der. Interestingly, this effect does not rely on electron 
interactions, as even a single particle in a magnetic field 
exhibits behaviour similar to that of multiple particles. 
The quantization of the Hall resistance occurs in dis-
tinct plateaus, each corresponding to a specific num-
ber of filled Landau levels. Crucially, edge states along 
the boundaries of the system, known as chiral modes, 
play a pivotal role in maintaining the quantization of 
the Hall conductivity. These edge states, a consequence 
of the system’s topological properties, remain robust 
against external perturbations. The QHE has revolu-
tionized our understanding of condensed matter phys-
ics, inspiring new theories and driving experimental 
advancements, emphasizing the significance of topo-
logical properties in electronic systems under strong 
magnetic fields (“Fractional quantum Hall effect at zero 
magnetic field observed in an unexpected material” 
2024; Klitzing, et al. 2020).
Time-reversal symmetry plays a significant role in clas-
sifying topological states. Sometimes, TIs exhibit a Z2 
invariant, indicating whether the material is a trivial insu-
lator or a nontrivial topological insulator (Lan et al. 2022). 
This Z2 invariant is protected by time-reversal symmetry 
and determines the presence of protected edge states. 
TIs are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by 
the spin–orbit interaction that differs from conventional 
insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z2 topo-
logical invariants representing the ground state. A single 
Z2 invariant distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the 
quantum spin-Hall phase in two dimensions (2017). Four 
Z2 invariants distinguish the ordinary insulator from 
‘weak’ and ‘strong’ TIs in three dimensions. These phases 
are characterized by gapless surface (or edge) states (Lan 
et al. 2022).

The anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) 
(Ramallo 2016) correspondence is a theoretical frame-
work that relates specific strongly interacting quantum 
field theories to higher-dimensional gravitational theo-
ries. Certain topological states, like TIs, can be con-
nected to gravitational theories in a higher-dimensional 
space, suggesting a deep connection between topology 
and gravity.
In this section, we delve into the unique properties of 
QMs, particularly focusing on quantum confinement, 
strong electronic correlation, topology, and symmetry. 
Reviewing all these properties in one go is challenging, 
but we aim to provide a concise overview. To facilitate 
a better understanding of these properties in a sin-
gle location, we include Fig. 5, which depicts all these 
properties simultaneously.
Applications of QMs
QMs, at the forefront of materials science, have ignited 
a revolution in technology and applications. These 
remarkable materials, with their unique electronic 
and optical properties arising from quantum mechani-
cal effects, hold immense promise for a wide range of 
exceptional applications. From ultra-efficient photode-
tectors to quantum computing, QMs drive innovation 
and redefine the boundaries of what is possible in elec-
tronics, energy storage, and beyond. As we delve deeper 
into their properties and harness their potential, we are 
poised to unlock a new era of technological advance-
ment that will shape the future in ways we are only 
beginning to imagine. In the following subsections, we 
will provide significant experimental studies reported 
in the last 5  years of QMs from the perspective of 
potential applications of QMs. In Table  1, we include 
different types of QMs and corresponding fundamental 
key properties and application with a suitable reference.
Advanced electronics
QMs-based electronic devices are revolutionizing tech-
nology and materials science, offering remarkable prop-
erties and diverse applications. QDs leverage quantum 
confinement effects for precise control over electronic 
and optical properties. Nanowires provide a platform for 
ultra-compact, high-performance devices with excep-
tional electronic transport properties and versatile inte-
gration possibilities. 2D materials, like graphene and 
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), enable the 
development of ultra-thin and flexible devices with out-
standing electrical, thermal, and mechanical character-
istics. These quantum material-based electronic devices 
hold promise across various fields, including electronics, 
photonics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing, 
fuelling innovation and pushing technology bounda-
ries. They represent the next generation of transistors, 
sensors, and high-performance computing, harnessing 
quantum mechanics for superior performance compared 
to traditional silicon-based electronics (Fig. 6).
In 2017, Takeda Hirotaka introduced an innovative 
approach to fabricating nanowires to create a remarkably 
transparent and electrically conductive nanowire film 
(“Nanowire, process for producing nanowires, nanowire 
dispersion, and transparent electroconductive film - n.d.). 
The proposed method involves the synthesis of nanowires

featuring a linearly interconnected structure formed by 
multiple particles. Notably, the nanowires are engineered 
with a carefully controlled diameter ratio falling within 
the range of 15 to 25 (A/B), ensuring that the resulting 
nanowire film exhibits outstanding transparency and 
excellent electrical conductivity. This breakthrough holds 
significant promise for applications requiring materials 
with dual transparency and electrical conduction charac-
teristics, opening new avenues for advanced technologies 
in fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and beyond.
In 2020, Zhong successfully synthesized silver nanow-
ires (AgNWs) through a polyol reduction process, 
employing ­FeCl3 and NaBr as reaction inhibitors (Zhong 
and Wang  2020). Notably, they found that varying the 
molar ratio of ­FeCl3 to NaBr influenced the yield of 
AgNWs but had minimal impact on their morphology. 
These AgNWs were then utilized to fabricate transparent 
conductive films on glass slides, exhibiting commendable 
electrical conductivity, high transmittance, and a smooth 
surface texture. The AgNWs film heaters displayed 
rapid heat response characteristics and efficient electro-
thermal conversion, achieved with low input voltages. 
Furthermore, they observed that these AgNWs films 
remained structurally intact up to 170 °C, beyond which 
they fused into discontinuous segments at 200 °C. Over-
all, his findings mark the promising potential of AgNWs 
for transparent and efficient heating applications, while 
shedding light on the nuanced relationship between reac-
tant ratios and nanowire yield.
In 2022, Xu et  al. developed a novel gas sensor that 
uses black phosphorus QDs (BP QDs) modified ­Ti3C2Tx 
nanosheets (BQ/Ti3C2Tx) as its sensing channel. This 
sensor shows remarkable performance in ­NO2 detec-
tion at room temperature (Xu et  al.  2022). This sen-
sor boasts a wide linear detection range, rapid response 
time, and exceptional specificity. Furthermore, the study 
delves into the influence of humidity and temperature 
on gas detection and introduces a practical calibration 
approach to mitigate humidity’s impact, thereby ensuring 
the precision of ­NO2 detection. The sensor’s heightened 
sensitivity and selectivity can be attributed to the aug-
mented adsorption energy of BQ/Ti3C2Tx towards target 
gas molecules and the formation of P-O-Ti bonds. This 
research provides valuable insights into developing sensi-
tive and selective gas sensors, highlighting the promise of 
functionalized MXene materials in this field.
A recent study by Li et al. in 2023 showcases the prom-
ising application of transfer printing QDs as an effec-
tive colour-converting layer for advancing full-colour 
micro-LED displays (Li et al. 2022). Through the strate-
gic design and creation of a distributed Bragg reflector 
(DBR), the study successfully enhances the colour purity 
of red and green light emitted by QDs while optimiz-
ing the utilization of blue light from micro-LEDs. This

technology’s implementation involves transferring red 
QDs onto the DBR as a colour-converting layer, subse-
quently integrated with blue micro-LEDs. This innova-
tive approach facilitates the down-conversion of blue 
emission from the micro-LEDs into vibrant red emission, 
thereby realizing a full-colour display. This research pre-
sents a significant step towards enhancing the quality and 
versatility of micro-LED displays, with potential appli-
cations ranging from consumer electronics to advanced 
visualization systems.
Chaudhary et  al., in 2023, explored the utilization of 
nitrogen-doped carbon QDs (CQDs) on graphene to 
develop field-effect transistor (FET) based optoelec-
tronic memories that are programmable via UV illumi-
nation (Chaudhary et al. 2023). The study showcases the 
successful creation of such memories, emphasizing the 
pivotal role played by the charge-trapping properties of 
nitrogen-doped CQDs in ensuring long-lasting mem-
ory retention. Additionally, the interaction between the 
CQDs and graphene FET enables a photo-gating effect, 
enhancing the versatility of these memories. Notably, the 
research reveals that memory erasure can be achieved by 
applying a positive gate bias, facilitating the removal of 
trapped charges through recombination. This work marks 
the immense potential for engineering high-performance 
all-carbon, non-volatile FET-based optoelectronic mem-
ories by manipulating and coupling charge-trapping 
properties between colloidal CQDs and graphene.
In 2023, Zhou et al. researched metal halide perovskite 
QDs, which possess remarkable optical properties that 
make them promising candidates for LED devices (Zhou 
et  al.  2023). However, the conventional ligands used in 
these QDs have limited their practical application due 
to their instability. In an exciting breakthrough, incor-
porating the dual-function ligand DDA-MeS has proven 
to be a game changer. This innovative approach has sig-
nificantly enhanced the electrical performance of green 
QDs-LED devices and yielded impressive results. With 
DDA-MeS, the external quantum efficiency soared to 
10.18%, the maximum brightness reached an impressive 
8025 cd/m2, and the turn-on voltage was reduced to just 
2.5 V. This success highlights the tremendous potential of 
dual-function ligands in advancing the performance of 
perovskite quantum dot LED devices, paving the way for 
brighter and more energy-efficient lighting solutions.
Cao et al. in 2023 achieved a significant breakthrough 
in lighting technology (Cao et  al. 2023). They success-
fully synthesized multicolour nitrogen-doped graphene 
QDs (NGQDs) through a one-pot method and refined 
the process further with column chromatography puri-
fication. These NGQDs exhibited three distinct emission 
colours: vivid blue, captivating cyan, and radiant yellow. 
Leveraging this innovation, the team integrated these 
NGQDs with InGaN chips to engineer LEDs capable of 
emitting these specific colours. Most notably, by strate-
gically reducing the number of yellow NGQDs used in 
the blend, they created a white LED with precise colour 
coordinates of (0.324 and 0.334). This achievement paves 
the way for developing highly customizable and energy-
efficient lighting solutions with broad applications 
in various fields.
Ali et  al. in 2022 found an intriguing phenomenon 
of the metal–insulator transition (MIT) within ­WSe2 
devices, focusing on the pivotal role played by the thick-
ness of the ­WSe2 channel and the associated unscreened 
charge impurity and trap density near the interface (Ali 
et al. 2022). Our investigation revealed a compelling rela-
tionship between the thickness of the ­WSe2 channel and 
the behaviour of the MIT. Specifically, as the ­WSe2 chan-
nel thickness decreases, they observed a pronounced 
increase in critical carrier and trap densities. This effect 
engendered significant potential fluctuations and charge 
density heterogeneity within the system. Notably, this 
tuneable MIT behaviour is predominantly attributed 
to the substantial rise in trap density as ­WSe2 thick-
ness diminishes. Remarkably, our findings highlight a 
remarkable congruence between thinner ­WSe2 devices 
and percolation theory, starkly contrasting the behaviour 
exhibited by multilayer ­WSe2 devices, which defy perco-
lation theory. This study marks the critical importance 
of thickness control in manipulating the metal–insulator 
transition dynamics in ­WSe2 devices and paves the way 
for novel applications in the field of nanoelectronics.
In 2022, Oh et  al. showcased 2D transition–metal 
dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors, namely ­MoS2, 
­MoTe2, and ­WSe2, which were skilfully employed to con-
struct van der Waals vertical heterostructures for tun-
nelling field-effect transistor (TFET) applications (Oh 
et al. 2022). The fabricated TFETs featuring ­MoS2/MoTe2 
or ­MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures exhibited remarkably 
low subthreshold swings of 9.1 mV/dec and 7.5 mV/dec, 
respectively. This remarkable achievement signifies the 
efficient band-to-band tunnelling processes harnessed 
in these devices. The electrical characteristics of these 
heterostructures were thoroughly investigated, reveal-
ing negative differential transconductance, negative dif-
ferential resistance, and temperature-dependent I–V 
characteristics, all of which solidified the band-to-band 
tunnelling mechanism. Incorporating atomically thin 2D 
materials and van der Waals vertical heterostructures in 
TFETs showcases substantial potential for advancing the

sensitivity, rapid response times, the potential for min-
iaturization, and the convenience of portable read-out 
systems (Rizzato et al. 2022). The integration of 2D nano-
materials into FETs has yielded auspicious outcomes, 
showcasing superior performance characteristics such 
as an impressive surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced car-
rier mobility, localized gating capabilities, heightened 
transconductance, and the ability to operate efficiently 
at low voltages. This paper delves into a comprehensive 
review of the progress and prospects of 2D materials in 
FET biosensors, shedding light on the myriad opportu-
nities, recent applications, associated challenges, and 
forthcoming possibilities. Indeed, integrating 2D nano-
materials into biosensors is key to unlocking heightened 
sensing capabilities and optimizing device performance. 
With their compact size and remarkable sensitivity, FETs 
are poised to revolutionize real-time monitoring across a 
broad spectrum of biomedical diagnostic applications.
A recent study in electronics materials by Zou and Noh 
(Zou and Noh 2023) introduced a solution-processed 2D 
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) which hold sig-
nificant promise for the future of complementary metal–
oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology, thanks to 
their atomic thinness and impressive electrical and 
mechanical properties. Nonetheless, the journey towards 
their practical application presents hurdles. Achieving 
scalable, high-purity 2D semiconductor mono- and few 
layers with sizable lateral dimensions and a narrow thick-
ness distribution remains a formidable challenge. Fur-
thermore, the field-effect mobility of solution-processed 
2D TMD transistors lags behind counterparts produced 
through alternative methods, with the underexplored 
realm of solution-processed p-type 2D TMD transis-
tors adding to the complexity. Despite these obstacles, 
there have been notable strides in developing solution-
processed CMOS devices utilizing both n-type and 
p-type 2D TMD transistors bolstered by advancements 
in deposition techniques, device fabrication, and CMOS 
applications. As this field progresses, ongoing research 
endeavours will be essential to surmount current limita-
tions and steer this technology toward its full potential.
Peng et al. show the presence of Weyl nodes in TaAs 
Weyl semimetals by angle-resolved photoemission 
spectroscopy, which suggests promising applications 
in thermoelectric devices due to their unique transport 
properties (Peng et  al.  2016). Using first-principles cal-
culations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, 
they examined the electrical transport behaviour of TaAs 
and found high anisotropy. The calculated Seebeck coef-
ficients align well with experimental data. Additionally, 
they analyse the lattice dynamics of TaAs, with phonon 
frequencies matching well with experimental observa-
tions and calculate the lattice thermal conductivity using 
a self-consistent iterative method. Anisotropy is also 
observed in the lattice thermal conductivity. For n-doped 
TaAs along the Z direction, they find a peak thermo-
electric figure of merit ZT of 0.63 at 900 K. Lastly, they 
also investigate the size-dependent behaviour of lattice 
thermal conductivity and thermoelectric properties, 
which provides insights for the design of thermoelectric 
nanostructures.
Quantum sensing and imaging
QMs are revolutionizing sensor technology and imaging. 
They offer unique properties like superconductivity and 
magnetism, enabling ultra-precise sensors for medical 
imaging and environmental monitoring. Integrating QMs 
into techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and microscopy enhances our ability to study atomic and 
molecular structures. Applications include highly sensi-
tive magnetometers for medical diagnostics and QDs 
sensors for biomolecular sensing. Interferometry involv-
ing QMs, such as Bose–Einstein condensates and atom 
interferometers, offers unparalleled precision in measur-
ing gravity and inertial forces. These sensors can detect 
minute changes in acceleration and rotation and find 
applications in navigation, geodesy, and tests of funda-
mental physics. In this section, QMs drive a new sensor 
development and imaging era, propelling scientific dis-
covery to new heights.
A study by Milekhin et al. in 2016 on surface-enhanced 
Raman scattering (SERS) within semiconductor nano-
structures (Milekhin et al. 2016). It investigates the mani-
festation of SERS through confined optical and surface 
optical phonons in a diverse range of materials, includ-
ing CdS, CuS, GaN, and ZnO nanocrystals, along with 
GaN and ZnO nanorods and AlN nanowires. The find-
ings reveal that SERS by phonons exhibits a resonant 
nature, with the most substantial enhancement observed 
in CdS nanocrystals and surface optical modes within 
ZnO nanocrystals. Moreover, this study unveils the aug-
mentation of Raman scattering due to confined optical 
phonons and the emergence of novel Raman modes with 
distinct frequencies distinct from those found in ZnO 
bulk. These phenomena are attributed to surface opti-
cal modes within the nanostructures and are validated 
through calculations employing the dielectric continuum 
model. Furthermore, SERS by phonons is harnessed as 
a powerful tool for exploring the phonon spectrum in 
nanocrystal ensembles characterized by an exception-
ally low areal density when coupled with metal plasmonic 
nanostructures. This research significantly advances our 
understanding of the intricate interplay between pho-
nons and nanostructures. It offers valuable insights into 
their resonant behaviour and the possibilities for phonon 
spectroscopy in the nanoscale regime.

Corgier et al. in 2020 introduced a novel source engi-
neering concept aimed at enhancing precision atom 
interferometry for binary quantum mixtures with 
extended drift times (Corgier et  al. 2020). The authors 
created a multi-stage, non-linear atomic lens sequence 
to generate dual ensembles characterized by ultra-slow 
kinetic expansion energies, specifically below 15 pK. 
This innovation serves the crucial purpose of mitigating 
wavefront aberrations, a prominent source of systematic 
errors in precision atom interferometry. Furthermore, 
the authors developed a scaling approach to address the 
non-linear dynamics of binary quantum mixtures, thus 
expanding the potential applications of this technique in 
scenarios involving various intra- and inter-species inter-
action regimes. This research opens exciting possibilities 
for achieving more precise and stable atom interferom-
etry measurements over extended timeframes.
Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamonds are quan-
tum defects with unique spin properties that allow them 
to sense magnetic and electric fields with high sensitiv-
ity. NV centres can detect small magnetic signals, such as 
in biomagnetism imaging and MRI, and measure electric 
field gradients in neuronal activity. In 2022, Bätge et al. 
delved into the domain of electric-field noise detection 
on the surface of the diamond, employing shallow NV 
centres as their investigative tools (Bätge et  al.  2022). 
Their exploration reveals a fascinating phenomenon: 
the electric-field noise exhibits a power-law frequency 
dependence, its behaviour intricately intertwined with 
temperature and the activation energies of two-level 
systems. As temperature ascends from 295 to 420  K, 
the noise experiences a gradual increase, but it dimin-
ishes swiftly at even higher temperatures. The origin of 
this noise lies in ensembles of two-level systems charac-
terized by activation energies spanning from 0.3  eV to 
0.6 eV, a behaviour elucidated by the Dutta–Horn model. 
Notably, the study indicates the superiority of solid cov-
ering material, specifically PMMA, over its liquid coun-
terpart, glycerol, in mitigating electric-field noise on the 
diamond surface. This superiority is attributed to the 
presence of surface-modified photonic coupling noise. 
Overall, this research enhances our comprehension of 
the underlying factors contributing to surface 1/f elec-
tric-field noise and sheds light on the choice of optimal 
covering materials for augmenting the coherence time of 
near-surface NV centres.
In a very recent study in 2023 by Jeffrey Neethi Neethi-
rajan, this paper delves into the formidable challenges 
confronting near-surface negatively charged NV cen-
tres, encompassing issues such as charge-state instabili-
ties, diminished fluorescence, and NV coherence time 
(Neethirajan et al. 2023). These impediments significantly 
hinder the sensitivity of magnetic imaging, a concern 
that becomes particularly pronounced at the demand-
ing conditions of 4  K and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). 
However, the authors present a promising solution by 
demonstrating the efficacy of in situ adsorption of ­H2O 
on the diamond surface, which offers a pathway toward 
the partial restoration of shallow NV sensors. They high-
light the pivotal role of controlled surface treatments as 
an indispensable element in implementing NV-based 
quantum sensing protocols under cryogenic UHV condi-
tions. This research paves the way for improved perfor-
mance and applications of NV-based quantum sensors in 
challenging environments.
Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) exploit quantum 
mechanical principles, providing coherent and tune-
able mid-infrared and terahertz radiation. QCLs are 
used in spectroscopy to identify specific molecular 
vibrations, enabling the detection of trace gases, pollut-
ants, and chemicals in diverse environments. Impactful 
research in 2020 by Yohei Matsuoka was carried out on 
QCL (Kim et  al. 2018). It is a remarkable semiconduc-
tor device that emits light through electronic transitions 
between subbands within a heterostructure conduction 
band, granting it the unique capability to emit light at 
multiple photon energies. This paper offers a compre-
hensive insight into the fundamental physics underpin-
ning QCLs, shedding light on their intricate fabrication 
process and introducing a novel approach to achiev-
ing enhanced power and brightness through broad-area 
QCLs. The paper also delves into the intriguing phys-
ics and optics associated with external cavity tuneable 
QCLs, which present the fascinating ability to finely 
tune the laser’s emission wavelength. In contrast to con-
ventional diode lasers, which emit light at a fixed energy 
level, QCLs exhibit the flexibility to emit light at various 
photon energies, making them a promising candidate for 
different applications in photonics and spectroscopy.
Yang et  al. in 2020 researched MRI and introduced 
an efficient and swift approach to fabricate Gd-doped 
­ZnCuFeS3 QDs adorned with surface ligands such as 
oleyl amine, oleic acid, and mercaptan (Yang et al. 2023). 
Due to their remarkable features, these QDs hold great 
promise as contrast agents in nuclear magnetic reso-
nance imaging. Notably, they exhibit an adjustable 
fluorescence spectrum, allowing for versatile imaging 
applications while maintaining stable chemical proper-
ties. This innovative method opens new possibilities for 
enhancing the precision and versatility of imaging tech-
niques, making it a valuable contribution to medical 
diagnostics and research.
In a study by Zhenjie Wang, ‘Single Photon Avalanche 
Diode (SPAD) Circuits For Ultra-Violet Imaging’ (Zhen-
jie Wang, Ivor Fleck, Bhaskar Choubey), the development 
of a compact CMOS—SPAD pixel tailored for ultra-violet

imaging is described. Achieved through a standard 
high-voltage CMOS process with a dedicated passiva-
tion opening for the diode, the pixel boasts dimensions 
of 35 × 40 μm and an 8% fill factor. An active quenching 
circuit is introduced to optimize avalanche quenching 
and recharge, significantly enhancing speed and reli-
ability. Additionally, incorporating a 9-bit digital coun-
ter within each pixel facilitates precise photo-counting 
operations. This innovative SPAD pixel holds promising 
potential for various applications in ultra-violet imag-
ing, particularly in scenarios requiring single-photon 
detection capabilities.
An impactful research by He et al. in 2022 developed 
a remarkable device featuring a substantial InGaAs 
absorption region complemented by an anti-reflection 
layer. This combination has yielded an impressive quan-
tum efficiency of 83.2% (He et  al.  2022). The device’s 
single-photon performance was meticulously assessed 
by implementing a quenching circuit, resulting in a 
remarkable maximum detection efficiency of 55.4%. Even 
more impressively, this achievement was accompanied 
by a dark count rate of just 43.8 kHz and an incredibly 
low noise equivalent power of 6.96 × ­10−17 W/Hz1/2 at a 
temperature of 247 K. What sets this device apart from 
previously reported detectors is its ability to maintain a 
higher single-photon detection efficiency while operating 
at a more elevated cooling temperature, underlining its 
promising potential for various applications in the field.
In a study (2022) by Liu Chen, ‘Avalanche-photo-
diode-based 
near-infrared 
single-photon 
detectors’, 
notably the InGaAs/InP variant, have become increas-
ingly popular owing to their exceptional sensitivity, 
rapid response times, and seamless integration capa-
bilities (Liu et al. 2022). This paper delves into the latest 
advancements and diverse applications of InGaAs/InP 
photodiodes, showcasing their continuous performance 
enhancements achieved through structural optimization 
and external quenching circuits. These detectors boast 
remarkable attributes, including substantial internal gain, 
heightened sensitivity, swift response, compact form 
factors, and ease of integration. Furthermore, the study 
provides a brief overview of alternative near-infrared 
single-photon detection technologies founded on novel 
materials and mechanisms, hinting at the promising 
potential for further breakthroughs in this dynamic field.
Quantum communication and information processing
QMs play several key roles in quantum communica-
tion and information processing. They are crucial for 
developing efficient quantum memory systems that 
store and retrieve light-generated quantum information. 
Ytterbium-based materials, for instance, show promise 
in this regard, as they can store and protect quantum 
information at high frequencies. QMs are essential for 
realizing quantum interconnects, including compo-
nents like quantum switches, repeaters, and frequency 
converters. These interconnects facilitate the transfer of 
quantum states between different devices while preserv-
ing coherence and entanglement. Certain QMs serve as 
platforms for implementing qubits, such as semiconduc-
tor QDs, colour centres in wide-bandgap materials, and 
superconducting materials, enabling diverse qubit types 
for quantum computing. Additionally, QMs with unique 
properties, like diamonds with colour centres, are used 
for quantum sensing, providing highly sensitive sen-
sors for various applications. Lastly, QMs are pivotal for 
quantum communication security, enabling protocols 
like quantum cryptography and quantum key distribu-
tion, which utilize superposition and entanglement to 
ensure unbreakable data encryption.
An impressive paper by Scappucci et al. in 2021 (Scap-
pucci et  al. 2021) shows the significance of high-purity 
crystalline solid-state materials in advancing quantum 
information processing, particularly in qubit technologies 
reliant on spins and topological states. It highlights the 
potential and challenges associated with semiconductor 
heterostructures for spin qubits, with GaAs, Si, and Ge 
as established platforms demonstrating two-qubit logic. 
Additionally, the abstract emphasizes the promise of top-
ologically non-trivial materials like topological insulator 
thin films and materials such as PbSnTe for creating top-
ological qubits. It calls attention to the need for advance-
ments in fabrication and characterization techniques 
to enable integration with Josephson junctions and the 
development of high-quality QMs. In conclusion, the 
paper identifies the most promising avenues for advanc-
ing qubit technology through enhancements in these 
material systems, with a strong emphasis on improving 
material quality and heterostructures to mitigate deco-
herence and enhance solid-state qubit performance.
In 2022, a study was carried out by Pelet et al., intro-
ducing an achievement in quantum communication, a 
metropolitan quantum network utilizing energy-time 
entanglement-based QKD (Pelet et  al. 2022). This pio-
neering system spans 50  km, connecting three nodes 
within Nice via optical fibres. It achieves a notable raw 
key rate of 40 Kbps per pair of channels and adheres to 
the ITU 100 GHz standard for telecom-grid compatibil-
ity. To bring this innovative network to life, the research-
ers harnessed a high-quality source of energy-time 
entangled photon pairs and implemented robust clock 
synchronization techniques, eliminating the need for 
dedicated communication channels. The post-treatment 
software facilitated real-time key generation, culminat-
ing in successfully establishing secret keys. This research 
marks a historic milestone by presenting the world’s

first fully operational entanglement-based metropoli-
tan quantum network, demonstrating its feasibility and 
remarkable performance in a real-world setting.
In 2024, Scheie and Tennant closely examined ­KYbSe2 
by simulations, entanglement analysis, and neutron spec-
troscopy, which approximates a 2D quantum spin liquid 
(“A proximate model material for triangular lattice quan-
tum spin liquids” 2023). It shows magnetic ordering at 
low temperatures. Its magnetic behaviour is driven by 
fractionalized excitations with unusually high quantum 
entanglement, suggesting that ­KYbSe2 displays quantum 
spin liquid characteristics over finite timescales. Apply-
ing entanglement witnesses from quantum information 
theory offers valuable insights into the physics of newly 
synthesized materials in condensed matter research.
Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent a quantum-dis-
ordered state characterized by significant entanglement 
and fractionalized excitations. As a highly pursued state 
of matter, QSLs are anticipated to host spinon excitations 
and emerge in systems with frustrated spins and substan-
tial quantum fluctuations. A study by and Tennant (2024) 
presents experimental evidence and theoretical model-
ling of QSL characteristics in monolayer 1 T-NbSe2 (“A 
proximate model material for triangular lattice quan-
tum spin liquids” 2023). It shows a new two-dimen-
sional material with charge density wave and correlated 
insulating properties. Scanning tunnelling microscopy 
and spectroscopy confirm spin fluctuations in mon-
olayer 1 T-NbSe2 by observing the Kondo resonance as 
it interacts with metallic monolayer 1H-NbSe2. Further 
STM/STS imaging at the Hubbard band energy reveals a 
long-wavelength charge modulation consistent with the 
spinon modulation expected in QSLs. These observa-
tions highlight monolayer 1 T-NbSe2 as a promising QSL 
candidate.
Resonant excitation of electronic transitions using 
coherent laser sources enables the formation of quan-
tum coherent superpositions among electronic states. 
While most time-resolved studies have concentrated on 
gases or isolated subsystems within insulating solids for 
quantum information applications, Mankowsky et  al. 
focus on controlling orbital wavefunctions in the corre-
lated quantum spin liquid ­Tb2Ti2O7 (Mankowsky et  al. 
2024). Results demonstrate that resonant excitation with 
an intense THz pulse generates a coherent superposition 
of the lowest energy Tb 4f states, manifesting as a mac-
roscopic oscillating magnetic dipole detectable through 
ultrafast resonant X-ray diffraction. This approach to 
coherent control of orbital wavefunctions offers a prom-
ising technique for rapidly manipulating and exploring 
QMs.
QSLs have emerged as a central topic in magnetism 
research due to their distinctive characteristics, which 
include long-range entanglement, fractionalized exci-
tations, and topologically protected behaviours. The 
exploration of QSL candidates has recently expanded to 
include three-dimensional materials despite the chal-
lenge posed by reduced quantum fluctuations in higher 
dimensions. Gonzalez et al. explored the ­K2Ni2(SO4)3 3D 
spin liquid ­model, which belongs to the langbeinite fam-
ily and comprises two interconnected trillium lattices 
(Gonzalez et  al. 2024). Although this material displays 
magnetic ordering, it maintains a highly dynamic and 
correlated state. In this study, they investigate the mag-
netic properties of ­K2Ni2(SO4)3 through a combination 
of inelastic neutron scattering experiments, density func-
tional theory (DFT), pseudo-fermion functional renor-
malization group (PFFRG), and classical Monte Carlo 
simulations, achieving a strong correlation between theo-
retical and experimental findings. The analysis attributes 
the dynamic state in ­K2Ni2(SO4)3 to a magnetic network 
of tetrahedra arranged on a trillium lattice.
Weyl semimetals have attracted significant interest 
due to their unique topological properties, with nota-
ble implications across various research domains. When 
integrated with s-wave superconductors, these materials 
can support supercurrents along their topological surface 
states, creating junctions that mimic Majorana-bound 
states. Chiu presented a transmon-like superconduct-
ing quantum interference device (SQUID) utilizing lat-
eral junctions made from the Weyl semimetal Td-MoTe2 
and superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) leads (Chiu 
et  al.  2020). The SQUID is coupled to a readout cavity 
made of molybdenum rhenium (MoRe), whose high-
power response confirms the presence of the Josephson 
junctions (JJs). The circuit’s loop geometry allows tuning 
of the readout cavity’s resonant frequency by applying 
magnetic flux. They demonstrate a Josephson junction 
based on ­MoTe2 and a flux-tunable, transmon-like circuit 
incorporating Weyl semimetals. This study establishes a 
platform for using topological materials in SQUID-based 
quantum circuits, with potential applications in quantum 
information processing.
Energy conversion and storage
QMs have emerged as revolutionary components in 
energy conversion and storage devices, transcending the 
limitations of classical materials. Their exceptional prop-
erties, often harnessed at the nanoscale, enable leaps 
in efficiency and performance. In energy conversion, 
QMs like perovskite solar cells exhibit unprecedented 
light-harvesting capabilities, efficiently converting sun-
light into electricity. Similarly, QDs offer tuneable elec-
tronic and optical properties, enhancing the efficiency 
of LEDs and photodetectors. QMs such as graphene and 
TIs in energy storage contribute to supercapacitors and

batteries with enhanced charge storage and faster energy 
release. Quantum phenomena like entanglement can be 
leveraged to develop quantum-enhanced devices for even 
more efficient energy conversion and storage, paving the 
way for a sustainable energy future. In this section, we 
will describe the utilization of QMs in energy conversion 
and storage devices and discuss advancements in quan-
tum dot solar cells, thermoelectric materials, and quan-
tum-enhanced energy storage.
Due to their unique properties, tin oxide QDs ­(SnO2 
QDs) are gaining attention for energy storage. Tin oxide 
is an eco-friendly semiconductor with stability, and it is 
found in solar cells, capacitors, batteries, and gas sensors 
(Xiao et al. 2018). ­SnO2 QDs have advantages like high 
surface area for better reactions, cost-effectiveness, high 
capacity, fast charging, stability, and compatibility with 
other materials. In a study, a hybrid of ­SnO2 QDs and 
activated carbon showed a capacitance of 222 ­Fg−1 and 
high energy/power densities (Zarshad et al. 2021). These 
composite holds promise for portable electronics and 
energy storage systems.
Cadmium sulfide (CdS) QDs possess a large surface 
area and low band gap (2.42 eV), making them vital II–
IV semiconductors (Kyobe et al. 2016). Their exceptional 
electrochemical, optical, and fluorescence properties are 
ideal for pharmaceutical analysis and element detection. 
CdS QDs’ effectiveness is influenced by their size and 
structure, prompting research into proper forms and 
dimensions. Various methods, like sol–gel, hydrother-
mal, organic solvent, and microwave processes, produce 
CdS QDs with different properties. Smaller CdS QDs 
exhibit improved capacitance and cyclic stability. Recent 
studies highlight CdS QDs’ potential as electrode mate-
rials in supercapacitors (SCs) due to their high capaci-
tance, cycling stability, and rapid charge–discharge rates. 
Organometallic perovskites and CdS QDs were used in 
layers for thin-film electrochemical capacitors, enhanc-
ing cycling properties and energy densities. Challenges 
include CdS QDs’ low conductivity and toxicity, prompt-
ing strategies like carbon-based hybridization and non-
toxic alternatives. While CdS QDs hold promise for 
SC electrodes, further research is needed to address 
challenges and fully unlock their potential, potentially 
through innovative synthesis methods, hybridization, 
and exploring non-toxic alternatives (Li et al. 2020; Wang 
et al. 2018).
QDs of ­MoS2 have caught the attention of researchers 
due to their unique properties, like light interactions and 
electrical behaviour (Arul and Nithya 2016). These dots 
have various potential applications in sensors, energy, 
and healthcare. They are small and emit controllable 
light, making them useful for biosensors and imaging 
(Fan et al. 2015). Scientists have found different ways to 
make ­MoS2. They used techniques like UV–vis’s absorb-
ance, luminescence, and microscopy to study the dots’ 
size and appearance. Compared to other ­MoS2 struc-
tures, these dots showed better performance in terms of 
their electrical behaviour. They had a more significant 
potential range and higher capacity. A device using these 
dots also showed impressive stability and retained its 
capabilities even after many use cycles.
Recent advancements in 2D layered inorganic mate-
rials, like monolayer and few-layer sheets of tungsten 
disulfide ­(WS2) and other dichalcogenides, are currently 
under close investigation (Štengl et al. 2015). ­WS2, with 
its unique trigonal prismatic structure, falls under transi-
tion metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and shares a layered 
arrangement like graphite (Xia et  al.  2019). Due to its 
potential applications in solid lubricants, lithium batter-
ies, bioimaging, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and 
more, researchers are actively exploring the controlled 
production of innovative and superior ­WS2 micro-nano-
materials, sparking widespread interest.
The porous graphene sheet combined with attached 
GQDs forms a GQDs/Gr hetero junction, enhancing 
ionic diffusion and active sites for ion storage. At the 
same time, AL contributes to activated carbon with a 
dense pore structure. The hybrid supercapacitor works 
up to a 1.4 V voltage (as shown in the charts) and exhib-
its specific capacitances of 9.8, 8.5, 7.28, 6.45, and 5.85 F 
­cm−3. The CV curves and GCD profiles reveal pseudo-
capacitive charge storage alongside EDLC. S, N-GQDP2 
nanocomposite excels with an estimated 645 ­Fg−1 
Csp, outperforming pure PANI, S, N-GQDP1, and S, 
N-GQDP3 samples at 177, 224, and 134 ­Fg−1, respectively 
(Ramkumar and Minakshi  2015). Heteroatom-doped S, 
N-GQDs exhibit enhanced capacitance due to sulphur 
and nitrogen trapping electrolyte ions. The incorporation 
of heteroatoms boosts conductivity. Similar enhance-
ments are seen with ­CoMoO4 nanosheets modified with 
chitosan. Combining pseudo-capacitor and quasi-zero-
dimensional carbon materials enhances energy storage 
through their high surface area, conductivity, and stabil-
ity. Further research is necessary for optimization. Solu-
tion- and solid-type electrolytes employ GQDs with acid 
oxygen groups for improved supercapacitor performance 
(Sun et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2011; Bhojane 2022). Neutral-
izing acidic GQD groups enhances capacitance efficiency 
and rate capability. The storage capacity of nanocrystals 
and SP-derived CDs in an ­H2SO4 electrolyte increases 
with electrolyte amount, yielding 643 ­mFcm−2 due to 
reduced resistance and better wettability.
Various characterization techniques were employed to 
study synthesized graphene QDs (GQDs). Electrochemi-
cal experiments were used to explore GQDs’ supercapac-
itive properties (Rabeya et al. 2022). An electrode made

from GQDs demonstrated a specific capacitance (SC) of 
257 F ­g−1 at 3 ­Ag−1 current density, retaining 96% capaci-
tance after 3000 cycles. GQDs were also used as active 
material in a flexible symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) 
with promising outcomes even after 1000 cycles. The 
SSC exhibited a rectangular cyclic voltammogram (CV) 
shape, indicative of reversible ion adsorption–desorption 
and a dual-layer capacitive nature. Galvanostatic charge–
discharge (GCD) tests displayed symmetrical triangular 
curves with minimal internal resistance drops, confirm-
ing high-rate capabilities. The SC values at varying cur-
rent densities were calculated, highlighting the devices’ 
resilience to high current densities. Stability tests further 
validated the long-term performance (Yoon et al. 2014). 
Additionally, GQDs were employed as solid-state elec-
trolytes, offering stability and compatibility with various 
electrode materials. The work extended to transparent 
and flexible micro-supercapacitors using GQDs, exhibit-
ing remarkable transparency, energy storage, quick relax-
ation time, cycle retention, and stability (Song et al. 2018; 
Lu et  al.  2018). The synergy between ­MoS2 QDs and 
PANI in a hybrid conductive xerogel enhanced capaci-
tance and stability (Zhao et  al.  2015). The study dem-
onstrated the potential for novel energy storage devices 
with wide-ranging applications.
Demand for energy storage devices has spurred the 
need for cost-effective QDs production, focusing on their 
potential applications in batteries and supercapacitors 
(Arul and Nithya  2016). These applications heavily rely 
on the nature of electrode materials, where carbonaceous 
materials, particularly graphene and its nanometer-
sized derivatives known as GQDs, have exhibited excel-
lent electrochemical properties due to their structure 
(Liu et  al.  2021). GQDs offer unique attributes such as 
electron–hole pairs for conductivity, functionalization 
potential, and wettability for improved electrochemical 
properties. QDs also act as templates for distinct struc-
tures and can be incorporated through various methods. 
Recent studies highlight the impact of quantum dot mor-
phology on the electrochemical performance of compos-
ite materials (Zhao et al. 2020). For instance, CdS QDs 
with rod-like morphologies displayed enhanced charge 
storage capacity and cycling stability, a crucial considera-
tion in organic polymer composites for supercapacitor 
applications. Additionally, the synthesis of quantum dot 
composites as anode materials for energy storage devices 
has shown promising results, such as ­TiO2 QDs anchored 
on graphene for rapid and stable lithium/sodium storage 
(Zhu et al. 2017). These innovative advances, along with 
ongoing research, hold the potential to shape the future 
of sustainable and renewable energy sources, addressing 
pressing environmental challenges and transforming the 
energy landscape.
A very recent and very effective study by Wang et al. 
in 2023 (Wang et  al.  2018) on the potential of GQDs 
as interfacial engineering materials for perovskite solar 
cells (PSC) underlining their appeal due to their low 
toxicity and superior charge mobility when compared 
to other metallic-based QDs within semiconductor 
applications. However, it also raises a crucial concern 
about the emergence of structural defects attributed to 
the use of GQDs, leading to the formation of shallow 
trap states that contribute to decreased PSC perfor-
mance. To shed light on this issue, the paper employs 
thermally stimulated current (TSC) and density–volt-
age (J–V) plots as analytical tools, offering valuable 
insights into the influence of structural defects and trap 
states on PSC efficiency. To mitigate these challenges, 
the paper proposes implementing a carefully controlled 
fabrication process, thus offering a path forward to har-
nessing the potential of GQDs while minimizing their 
associated trade-offs in PSC technology.
Another recent study of 2023 by Li et al. on indium 
oxide QDs ­(In2O3) was successfully incorporated into 
a ­MAPbI3 film, effectively addressing the issue of low 
film quality caused by inherent defects (Li et al. 2020). 
Introducing ­In2O3 QDs led to a remarkable improve-
ment in film quality by suppressing these defects. The 
resulting ­MAPbI3:In2O3 film exhibited optimized time-
resolved photoluminescence component ratios, which 
indicated enhanced carrier dissociation and improved 
transport efficiency. When this advanced film was 
employed in the fabrication of solar cells, it yielded sig-
nificant improvements in performance metrics. Spe-
cifically, the solar cells using the ­MAPbI3:In2O3 film 
demonstrated higher fill factor, short circuit current 
density, and power conversion efficiency than those 
using the ­MAPbI3 film alone. These findings pave the 
way for developing more efficient and reliable solar cell 
technologies, with the potential for significant advance-
ments in renewable energy generation.
In a study in 2023 by Wang et al. about the domain 
of advanced photodiodes and  solar  cells (Wang 
et  al.  2023) explores the design and performance of a 
2D ­ReS2/MoS2 semi-vertical heterojunction photodiode 
with a unilateral depletion region, showcasing remark-
able attributes such as self-powered capability, a broad 
photovoltaic response, high responsivity, power con-
version efficiency, and excellent detectivity. Moreover, 
this photodiode exhibits an impressively rapid response 
time and a detectable signal cut-off frequency, render-
ing it highly suitable for demanding photodiode appli-
cations. The outstanding performance of the 2D ­ReS2/
MoS2 semi-vertical heterojunction photodiode makes 
it a promising candidate for various high-performance 
photodiode applications. Furthermore, incorporating

photosensitive PbS QDs into the heterojunction fur-
ther amplifies its sensitivity, resulting in a significant 
21% enhancement in device responsivity under 532 nm 
illumination. This underlines the immense potential of 
­ReS2/MoS2 heterostructures for utilization in advanced 
photodiodes and solar cells.
Another very recent study in 2023 by Nanxin Fu intro-
duces a novel photodetector device that capitalizes on a 
hybrid dimensional heterostructure incorporating mul-
tiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and multi-layered 
­MoS2 (Fu et al. 2023). This innovative approach enables 
the photodetector to achieve broadband detection capa-
bilities from visible to near-infrared light. The results 
are auspicious, with the device demonstrating excep-
tional responsivity, detectivity, and external quantum 
efficiency. Specifically, the photodetector exhibited a 
remarkable responsivity of 3.67 × ­103 A/W at a wave-
length of 520 nm and an impressive 718 A/W at 1060 nm. 
These values were accompanied by detectivity (D*) fig-
ures of 1.2 × ­1010 Jones at 520 nm and 1.5 × ­109 Jones at 
1060  nm. Moreover, the external quantum efficiency 
(EQE) values were strikingly high, measuring approxi-
mately 8.77 × ­105% at 520 nm and 8.41 × ­104% at 1060 nm. 
In summary, this research showcases the potential of 
mixed-dimensional heterostructures in photodetector 
technology, enabling proficient detection across visible 
and infrared spectra. This development paves the way for 
innovative optoelectronic devices built upon the foun-
dation of low-dimensional materials, marking a notable 
advancement in the field.
Advancements in energy conversion and storage tech-
nologies have greatly influenced the development of 
next-gen tech. Batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) play 
a crucial role in cutting-edge electronics. SCs are reli-
able for real-time applications due to their benefits, 
such as high-power density and long lifespan at lower 
costs. They are ideal for future energy-focused tech like 
solar systems, electric vehicles, and wind power (Prasath 
et al. 2018). Scientists are working to enhance SCs, and 
this review highlights QDs and nanocomposites’ role in 
improving SC performance. Effective QD use boosts SC 
efficiency, and QDs have broad applications in battery 
materials, medical tech, sensors, and more. The review 
zeroes in on QD-based electrode materials and flexible 
devices, showcasing their potential impact.
Spintronics applications and topological superconductors
TIs are intriguing materials with insulating bulk, but 
conductive surface states protected from scattering by 
symmetrical constraints and non-trivial band topology. 
These properties, arising from the interplay of quan-
tum mechanics and topology, hold immense potential 
for quantum computing and spintronics. TIs offer stable 
qubits less prone to decoherence, crucial for scalable 
quantum computers, while in spintronics, they combine 
electron spin with motion to create efficient spin currents 
for novel device functionalities, promising energy-effi-
cient computing and data storage solutions. Topological 
superconductors, with surface metal and interior super-
conducting states, Majorana fermions for faultless quan-
tum computing, while topological magnets exhibit chiral 
edge states, merging magnetism and topology for low-
energy loss electronic devices. These materials facilitate 
robust electronic states critical for reliable and fault-tol-
erant devices, and various growth methods exist for their 
fabrication.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) 
plays a crucial role in uncovering and understanding 
topological phases by revealing non-trivial electronic 
structures (Sobota et  al.  2021). Additionally, ARPES 
helps measure topological invariants that classify dif-
ferent phases and study the impact of external forces. 
A notable example is the topological magnet ­CoSn2S2 
(Kanagaraj et al. 2022), which displays fascinating mag-
netic properties and potential applications in storage. The 
quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for 
low-energy electronics and topological superconduct-
ing quantum computing, and efforts to enhance QAHE 
continue with high-throughput calculations predicting 
potential materials. These advances open doors for high-
temperature QAHE materials and innovative spintronics 
devices, harnessing properties for diverse applications 
like information storage and charge transport. Topologi-
cal states have been studied before, especially in topolog-
ical superconducting materials.
A physical property measurement system (PPMS) is a 
helpful tool to identify superconductivity in these materi-
als (Sharma et al. 2017). This transition is typically seen 
in temperature-dependent resistance, magnetization, 
and heat capacity. Heat capacity measurement at varying 
temperatures is a reliable way to analyse superconductor 
properties. There are additional methods to characterize 
topological superconducting materials, but they need to 
be more detailed here due to space limitations. Taking 
­PbTaSe2 as an example, it has topological surface states 
(Chang et  al.  2016). These surface states possess a dis-
tinct isolated band with helical spin texture due to their 
hybridization with bulk states and spin-momentum lock-
ing. This gives rise to helical topological superconductiv-
ity. The combination of topology and superconductivity 
results in a new quantum state, a topological supercon-
ductor, which is crucial for quantum computing. Over-
coming errors caused by decoherence is a significant 
challenge in quantum computing, and topological quan-
tum computing can solve this.

Majorana zero-energy modes on the surface of topo-
logical superconductors offer high fault tolerance for 
topological quantum computation. Anisotropic Majo-
rana-bound states have been observed, opening avenues 
for novel heterostructures (Fang et al. 2019). Topological 
superconductivity has been detected in various systems, 
with nanowires showing promise. Majorana fermions 
might emerge from coupling superconductors with spin–
orbit-coupled semiconductor nanowires (Frolov et  al. 
2020). These advancements hold potential for stable qubit 
modules in quantum computing and necessitate further 
research and understanding of the physics involved.
In 2023, Yoon et  al. conducted a study (Yoon 
et al. 2014). In this study, the researchers delved into the 
intriguing question of the origin of the planar thermal 
Hall effect within the Kitaev magnet α-RuCl3, a material 
thought to potentially host Majorana fermions and non-
Abelian anyons, vital components of Kitaev spin liquids. 
Previous observations of an unusual planar thermal Hall 
effect in α-RuCl3 had stirred controversy over whether it 
stemmed from Majorana fermions or bosonic magnons. 
To resolve this ambiguity, the authors conducted meticu-
lous low-temperature measurements of specific heat and 
thermal Hall conductivity, employing in-plane field rota-
tions as a discriminating factor. Their findings showcased 
a closure of the low-energy bulk gap and a sign reversal of 
the Hall effect along the honeycomb bond direction. They 
offered conclusive evidence favouring the Majorana-fer-
mion origin of the thermal Hall effect in α-RuCl3. These 
results bolster the notion that α-RuCl3’s field-induced 
quantum-disordered state harbours Majorana fermions 
and non-Abelian anyons, solidifying its status as a prom-
ising candidate for Kitaev spin liquids. This research suc-
cessfully settles the long-standing debate surrounding 
the thermal Hall effect’s origin, definitively supporting 
the Majorana-fermion hypothesis based on compelling 
experimental observations.
Han et  al. report on a quantum criticality crossover 
in the Kitaev quantum magnet α-RuCl3, which reveals 
two distinct universal scaling regimes (Han et al. 2023). 
α-RuCl3 exhibits symmetry-breaking antiferromagnetic 
ordering and long-range entangled topological order 
characteristics of a quantum spin liquid. Theoretical 
analyses of inelastic neutron scattering, ac-magnetic sus-
ceptibility, and specific heat measurements reveal a tran-
sition from Wilson–Fisher–Yukawa-type ‘conventional’ 
weak-coupling quantum criticality at high-energy scales 
to a heavy-fermion-type ‘local’ strong-coupling criticality 
at low energies. These results provide significant insights 
into the evolution of quantum criticality in topological 
systems where fermions and bosons interact, which leads 
to diverse types of deconfined fermions.
Beenakker et  al. 2023) underlined the significance of 
the method of tangent fermions in discretizing the Ham-
iltonian of TIs and superconductors. This method stands 
out for its exceptional ability to safeguard the topologi-
cal protection of massless excitations, whether Dirac or 
Majorana fermions. Tangent fermions operate within 
a 2 + 1-dimensional lattice framework with a tangent 
dispersion, sidestepping the problematic fermion dou-
bling lattice artifact that could otherwise jeopardize the 
system’s topological integrity. Although the resulting 
discretized Hamiltonian exhibits non-local character-
istics, it can be transformed into a localized generalized 
eigenproblem, ensuring its practicality in both spatial 
and temporal domains. Moreover, the paper delves into 
various applications of tangent fermions, encompassing 
phenomena such as Klein tunnelling, resistance to locali-
zation by disorder, the anomalous quantum Hall effect, 
and the intriguing concept of the thermal metal involving 
Majorana fermions. Altogether, the method of tangent 
fermions emerges as an auspicious approach for discre-
tizing the Hamiltonian of TIs and superconductors while 
upholding their topological protection and preserv-
ing the fundamental symmetries inherent in the Dirac 
Hamiltonian.
In 2022, Martin did an impressive review on the inter-
face of organic and inorganic for spin injection using 
carbon nanotubes and graphene for spintronics appli-
cations (Martin et  al.  2022). Another domain of quan-
tum technology called spintronics adds spin quantum 
degrees of freedom to CMOS devices. Since the dis-
covery of giant magnetoresistance in 1988 by Fert (Bai-
bich et  al.  1988) and Grunberg (Binasch et  al.  1989), 
spintronics has transformed everyday gadgets like hard 
drives and magnetic memories. This review focused on 
Carbon-based nanomaterials like nanotubes, graphene, 
and molecules, which are physically and chemically 
compatible. Their high electrical mobilities, weak spin 
dispersion, and hybridization lead to strong spin polari-
zations that meet the critical requirements of spintronic 
devices. In this regard, the first technological endeav-
our to integrate nanomaterials for spintronics shows 
superior spin diffusion lengths. They focus on material, 
physical, and chemical compatibility to achieve remark-
able performance in the next generation of spintronics 
devices. This novel approach needs advances in surface 
chemistry, spin transport physics, and device theory, 
as detailed in this article. Ongoing research is breaking 
new ground, with advancements like all-spin-logic cir-
cuits and neuromorphic chips nearing fruition. Carbon 
nanostructures like molecules, graphene, and nanotubes 
play a vital role. Recent experiments emphasize the sig-
nificance of calibrated tunnel barriers in graphene-based 
spin valves, boosting spin signals and diffusion length in

non-magnetic materials. These developments highlight 
spintronics’ dynamic nature and potential to revolution-
ize modern electronics.
Another study in 2021 on spintronics by Xu et  al. 
introduced a radio-frequency signal that produces spin 
dynamics in a spintronic resonator, which the spin-diode 
effect detects (Xu et al. 2021). Ferromagnetic metals and 
spin torque are used in such resonators. QMs can enable 
new technologies, such as transition metal oxides with 
phase transitions that give spintronic resonators hystere-
sis and memory. It highlights the impact of Ni, permalloy 
­(Ni80Fe20), and Pt layers over ­V2O3; the first-order phase 
transition causes systematic resonance response altera-
tions and hysteretic current control of the ferromagnetic 
resonance frequency. A DC current can locally change 
the state of the output signal to vary systematically. These 
findings show neuromorphic computing-relevant spin-
tronic resonator functions. The study reveals systematic 
alterations in resonance response and hysteretic current 
control of ferromagnetic resonance frequency. Moreo-
ver, it demonstrates the manipulation of output signal 
via state changes in ­V2O3 induced by a DC current. Tem-
perature significantly influences resonance amplitude, 
while structural phase transitions in ­V2O3 reshape ferro-
magnetic resonance conditions. Emphasizing the quan-
tum material spintronic resonator’s memory retention, 
this research underscores its remarkable and distinctive 
attributes.
A study by Swapnali Makdey in 2020 shows a novel and 
efficient approach for designing magnetic tunnel junc-
tions (MTJs) structures utilizing molybdenum disulfide 
­(MoS2)/GQDs/MoS2 (Makdey et al. 2020). They create a 
device that exhibits superior efficiency coupled with low 
power consumption. With 2D ­MoS2 as ferromagnetic 
electrodes and GQDs acting as barriers, the MTJ tunnel 
magnetoresistance reached 1450% at zero bias voltage. 
Investigating spin relaxation and magnetization relaxa-
tion further extended the spin’s lifetime. The proposed 
MTJ structure for spintronics demonstrated notable 
effectiveness, underscored by comparative analysis with 
existing MTJ designs.
A recent study on MTJs in 2022 by Zhan was carried 
out to explore the potential of 2D ­MnBi2Te4 by investi-
gating their spin-dependent electronic and transport 
properties (Zhan et al. 2022). In this study, they used the 
first principles of quantum transport simulations. They 
designed the MTJs based on 2D van der Walls layered 
­MnBi2Te4 and observed that by increasing the thickness 
of the ­MnBi2Te4 layers within the MTJs, the research 
found significant enhancements in spin polarization 
and TMR ratios at the Fermi level. TMR ratios of up to 
100% and 500% were observed for varying thicknesses 
of ­MnBi2Te4 layers, with a remarkable increase to 500% 
and 4000% when accounting for the spin–orbit coupling 
(SOC) effect. These findings represent the potential of 
­MnBi2Te4 -based MTJs for advancing spintronic device 
performance, suggesting promising avenues for further 
investigation and development in this field.
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have garnered significant 
attention as they provide unique platforms for investi-
gating fundamental physical phenomena and for appli-
cations in topotronics. Although numerous WSMs have 
been discovered. Finding WSMs with widely spaced Weyl 
points (WPs) in candidate materials has been challeng-
ing. Sun et al. theoretically demonstrate the presence of 
intrinsic ferromagnetic WSMs in ­BaCrSe2, with their 
non-trivial properties confirmed through Chern num-
ber calculations and analysis of Fermi arc surface states 
(Sun et al. 2023). Unlike previously known WSMs where 
WPs of opposite chirality are in close proximity, the WPs 
in ­BaCrSe2 exhibit a large spatial separation—extend-
ing to half of the reciprocal lattice vector—indicating 
high robustness against perturbations. These findings 
not only deepen the understanding of magnetic WSMs 
but also highlight ­BaCrSe2’s potential for applications in 
topotronics.
QMs for quantum computing
The exploration of QMs is pivotal for advancing quantum 
computing platforms, leveraging principles like quantum 
coherence, superconductivity, and topological properties. 
These specialized materials provide physical platforms 
for quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of quan-
tum information, allowing researchers to manipulate and 
control quantum states. QMs enable the development of 
stable and reliable qubits, which are essential for com-
plex calculations currently intractable for classical com-
puters. By focusing on the synthesis, characterization, 
and utilization of QMs, scientists aim to unlock the full 
potential of quantum computing, revolutionizing com-
putation with profound implications across diverse fields 
of science and technology. QMs facilitate the creation of 
multi-qubit systems interconnected for complex calcu-
lations, leveraging quantum behaviours like superposi-
tion and entanglement. Superconducting materials, for 
example, enable the creation of superconducting qubits, 
which are crucial for operations surpassing classical com-
puting capabilities. Quantum error correction, utilizing 
QMs, creates fault-tolerant qubits that are less sensitive 
to environmental disturbances, which is essential for reli-
able quantum computing. Specific QMs, such as those in 
superconducting qubits, play critical roles in specialized 
quantum computing approaches like quantum anneal-
ing, which exploits quantum tunnelling effects for opti-
mization problems. Researchers explore how quantum 
properties of materials inspire novel algorithms for more

efficient problem-solving, leveraging quantum parallel-
ism and interference.
An awe-inspiring study in 2021 by Oreg Yuval explored 
a quantum computing device comprising a carbon nano-
tube, superconducting substrate, and magnet, with a 
particular emphasis on the spin-triplet aspect and the 
longitudinal magnetic field. Furthermore, the study 
delves into an alternative quantum computing setup 
involving multiple superconducting substrates and a 
non-superconducting structure exhibiting robust spin–
orbit coupling interactions, highlighting the significance 
of phase variations among substrate order parameters. 
The paper’s conclusion affirms the feasibility of con-
structing a quantum computing device using a carbon 
nanotube, superconducting substrate, and longitudinal 
magnetic field, with a keen focus on the spin-triplet ele-
ment. Additionally, it posits that an alternative quantum 
computing apparatus can be realized by utilizing multiple 
superconducting substrates and a non-superconducting 
structure with potent spin–orbit coupling interactions, 
stressing the importance of phase distinctions within 
substrate order parameters.
A review by Lordi and Nichol in 2021 (Lordi and 
Nichol 2021) discussed the immense potential of quan-
tum computers over classical counterparts; the presence 
of noise and material imperfections has emerged as a 
formidable obstacle. The ongoing progress in materials 
synthesis, characterization, and modelling is a pivotal 
cornerstone in surmounting these challenges, thereby 
unlocking the full capabilities of quantum computing. In 
recent years, these advancements have catalysed excit-
ing breakthroughs in the noisy intermediate-scale quan-
tum (NISQ) realm, where the delicate balance between 
preserving the excellence of single qubits and facilitating 
high-fidelity qubit interactions is paramount. As we look 
ahead, it becomes evident that the continued advance-
ment in the synthesis, characterization, and modelling of 
materials for quantum computing will remain integral to 
shaping the future landscape of quantum technology.
An impactful review was carried out in 2022 by Hoff-
mann (Hoffmann et al. 2022). In this review, he focused 
on neuromorphic computing, which relies on QMs to 
efficiently process extensive data volumes, as these mate-
rials possess distinctive properties that facilitate energy-
efficient hardware implementations of neuromorphic 
concepts. These materials display robust correlations, 
leading to profoundly non-linear responses that can be 
effectively utilized for both short- and long-term plastic-
ity and data classification. In conclusion, the utilization 
of QMs holds significant promise for enabling energy-
efficient neuromorphic computing at the hardware level, 
thanks to their inherent characteristics, which empower 
them to offer valuable solutions in data processing and 
artificial intelligence.
In a most recent study in 2023 by Jackson et  al., he 
introduced diamond-like structures where ­Li+ ions and 
diamines replace carbon atoms and C–C bonds, respec-
tively, creating novel materials capable of hosting diffuse 
electrons around each lithium tetra-amine centre (Jack-
son et al. 2023). These materials display either metallic or 
semiconductor properties, contingent upon the length of 
the diamine chain. Our gas-phase calculations accurately 
predict the properties of proposed crystalline Li-diamine 
materials, offering the potential for further development 
and insights. Through spin-polarized and unpolarized 
calculations across various hydrocarbon sizes, we reveal 
valuable information about their geometrical and elec-
tronic band structures, spin density contours, and density 
of states. These materials hold promise for applications 
such as redox reactions and quantum computing, where 
diffuse electrons can be harnessed as qubits. Our future 
endeavours will tailor the hydrocarbon backbone to con-
trol electron association for precise quantum comput-
ing and propose materials suitable for selective redox 
catalysis.
Metamaterials or metasurfaces, optics and photonics 
applications
In recent years, metamaterials and metaphotonics have 
seen rapid advancements, which have significantly trans-
formed the landscape of optics. Traditional, bulky opti-
cal systems, which consist of large lenses, mirrors, and 
prisms, are now replaced with thin, nanostructured films 
known as metasurfaces. These are designed with micro-
scopic patterns at the scale of light’s wavelength, and 
they can manipulate light in highly precise ways and offer 
new capabilities in optical systems that were once unim-
aginable with conventional optical elements. Metasur-
faces operate by controlling light’s phase, amplitude, and 
polarization to allow extraordinary functionality. This 
ability to manipulate light at a fundamental level has led 
to innovative developments in classical optics, including 
beam shaping, lensing, and imaging. Metasurfaces have 
been used to replace bulky optical devices with flat, com-
pact alternatives, enabling a wide range of applications in 
areas like telecommunications, imaging systems, and dis-
play technologies. Their ability to perform complex opti-
cal functions with a much smaller footprint transforms 
industries and enables miniaturized, high-performance 
optical devices. Recently, these innovations in metamate-
rials and metasurfaces have begun to influence quantum 
photonics (a field dealing with light’s quantum proper-
ties). Quantum photonics seeks to harness the peculiar 
properties of light at the quantum level, such as quan-
tum state superposition, quantum entanglement, and

non-classical photon statistics. These phenomena are 
central to emerging technologies like quantum commu-
nication, quantum computing, and cryptography. In the 
quantum realm, light behaves in ways that are fundamen-
tally different from its classical counterpart. For instance, 
quantum light sources, such as single-photon sources, 
emit individual photons that can exist in superposition, 
meaning they can be in multiple states simultaneously. 
Additionally, quantum entanglement allows for two par-
ticles (or photons) to become correlated so that the state 
of one instantaneously affects the state of the other, even 
if they are far apart. These phenomena are essential for 
the development of quantum technologies.
Applying metasurfaces to quantum photonics is an 
exciting frontier beginning to unfold. By integrating 
metasurfaces with quantum light source and detec-
tors, researchers are exploring novel ways to generate, 
manipulate, and detect non-classical light. For example, 
metasurfaces can be engineered to selectively control the 
quantum properties of photons, such as their polariza-
tion or momentum, allowing for the creation of advanced 
quantum optical devices like entangled photon sources 
or quantum gates for quantum computing. In addition 
to manipulating light, metasurfaces can improve single-
photon detection, an essential task for many quantum 
communication and sensing applications. Traditional 
single-photon detectors have limitations in terms of effi-
ciency and speed. Still, by coupling these detectors with 
metasurfaces, it is possible to enhance their performance, 
making them more sensitive and capable of detecting sin-
gle photons at higher rates. In this perspective, Solnstev 
wrote an impressive and in-depth review of the recent 
progress in the emerging field of quantum-photonics 
applications of metasurfaces (Solntsev et al. 2021). They 
focused on the innovative and promising approaches 
researchers are exploring to use metasurfaces to con-
trol and manipulate non-classical light. This includes 
advancements in quantum light generation, manipulation 
of photon entanglement, and the development of highly 
efficient quantum light detectors. The unique proper-
ties of metasurfaces are opening new possibilities in the 
realm of quantum photonics, providing tools to realize 
applications that were once thought to be beyond reach. 
This exciting new field holds immense potential for 
advancing quantum technologies and could lead to trans-
formative breakthroughs in quantum communication, 
quantum computation, and beyond.
Metasurfaces have emerged as a key area in optical 
research, offering exceptional functionalities for appli-
cations such as imaging, beam shaping, holography, 
and polarimetry, while maintaining compact device 
sizes. Although a wide array of fundamental metasur-
face designs has been extensively explored, research in 
this field is expanding rapidly. Metasurfaces are now 
influencing lots of areas like computational imaging, 
augmented and virtual reality, automotive technologies, 
displays, biosensing, non-linear and quantum optics, 
optical computing, and more. The capability of meta-
surfaces to deliver optical functions within compact 
systems has spurred significant interest across various 
industries that benefit from miniaturized, efficient, and 
cost-effective optical components suitable for integra-
tion into optoelectronic systems. This expanding inter-
est presents a unique opportunity for metasurfaces to 
make substantial scientific and industrial contributions. 
Very recently, in 2024, Kuznetsov et  al. have written 
a review article ‘a roadmap for optical metasurfaces’ 
(Kuznetsov et  al.  2024). The purpose of this roadmap 
is to highlight the current ‘golden age’ of metasurface 
research and outline future directions to inspire ongo-
ing advancements toward scientific achievement and 
widespread industrial application. It is a good resource 
for readers to explore in depth about metasurfaces.
Two-dimensional arrays of engineered nanostruc-
tures have been a key driver in miniaturizing various 
optical functions and devices. The range of materi-
als for metasurfaces has broadened significantly, with 
recent years seeing a rise in meta-optical elements 
made from high-index, transparent materials exhibiting 
strong non-linear and electro-optic properties. Crys-
talline lithium niobate ­(LiNbO3), a leading material in 
integrated photonics, has demonstrated substantial 
potential for new meta-optical applications due to its 
high electro-optic coefficient, second-order non-linear 
response, and wide transparency range from visible to 
mid-infrared wavelengths. Advances in nanofabrication 
have now enabled the development of ­LiNbO3-based 
metasurfaces, marking a significant step toward 
ultrathin, monolithic non-linear light sources, efficient 
quantum photon-pair sources, and electro-optic modu-
lators. Fedotova’s review highlights these recent devel-
opments, explores their prospective applications, and 
discusses potential challenges and limitations of these 
emerging ­LiNbO3 metasurface technologies (Fedotova 
et al. 2022).
Weyl semimetals offer significant potential to trans-
form non-reciprocal optical components due to their 
distinct topological features. These materials can exhibit 
non-reciprocal magneto-optical effects without need-
ing an external magnetic field, which makes them ideal 
for miniaturized, energy-efficient designs. Their intrin-
sic topological stability limits tunability, which is essen-
tial for some applications. Chistyakov presents a novel 
method to increase their tunability by employing mul-
tilayered, twisted configurations of anisotropic Weyl 
semimetals (Chistyakov et al. 2023). Their design enables

controlled and reversible isolation by varying the twist 
angle between anisotropic layers. In the mid-IR fre-
quency range, this setup achieves notable isolation above 
50 dB with an insertion loss of only 0.33 dB in the Fara-
day geometry. Additionally, the in-plane anisotropy in 
Weyl semimetals can eliminate one or both polarizers in 
typical isolator setups, significantly reducing device size. 
This advancement paves the way for versatile, ultra-com-
pact optical isolators, promising to advance integrated 
photonics and quantum technologies.
Also, Weyl semimetals have unique optical proper-
ties, particularly in the mid-infrared region. However, 
the potential for developing optical polarizers based on 
Weyl semimetals remains largely unexplored. Hong et al. 
recently presented numerical simulations under the Voigt 
geometry, demonstrating that an ultra-thin Weyl semi-
metal film (thickness L = 100 nm) can achieve a remark-
able polarization extinction ratio exceeding 40 dB, with a 
broad acceptance angle (Hong et al. 2024). The proposed 
sandwich structure also allows fine-tuning of the TE 
mode transmission peak, resulting in reduced insertion 
loss (from 0.06 dB to 0.03 dB) and a wider-angle accept-
ance range (from 49.5° to 71°). By incorporating a gradi-
ent Fermi level structure, the design effectively eliminates 
Fabry–Perot cavity resonance and significantly increases 
bandwidth (around 60% improvement). This ultra-thin, 
wide-angle polarizer holds great promise for applications 
in optical communications and omnidirectional polariza-
tion detection.
Novel topological semimetal materials and their 
exotic non-equilibrium properties spark significant 
fundamental interest. It opens exciting possibilities for 
new applications, particularly in light-induced phe-
nomena such as non-linear optics and optoelectron-
ics. These are especially promising for terahertz (THz) 
technology, which benefits from the gapless nature of 
their electronic structures. He et  al. explored type-
II Weyl semimetals, which exhibit strong non-linear 
interactions with THz waves due to their complex 
quantum wavefunctions and distinctive band struc-
tures (He et al. 2024). They report the selective growth 
of the type-II Weyl semimetal ­NbIrTe4 using a self-flux 
method, a material known for its strongly tilted Weyl 
cones and unique Fermi arcs. The engineered oscillating 
THz field, generated by an antenna, is structured in a 
planar metal-topological semimetal-metal design with 
van der Waals stacking, facilitating self-powered pho-
todetection at room temperature. Their findings high-
light the exceptional performance of ­NbIrTe4-graphene 
heterostructure photodetectors, with a responsivity 
of up to 264.6 V/W at 0.30 THz, a fast response time 
of 1 µs, and a low noise equivalent power of 0.28 nW 
­Hz−0.5 which demonstrates high-quality imaging at THz 
frequencies. These results promise significant advances 
in using topological Weyl semimetals for efficient low-
energy photon harvesting.

various types of studies from past years. With this, for a 
deep understanding of applications, we have included a 
helpful reference in Table 2, where we cite recent review 
papers that delve into the diverse applications of QMs. 
This table is a valuable resource for readers seeking a 
more comprehensive insight into the subject. This sec-
tion explores numerous applications and critical research 
prospects related to QMs. Various synthesis methods are 
available to prepare the QMs. Advantages and challenges 
of some of the common methods are given in below 
Table 3.
Conclusion and outlook
QMs, with their unique properties arising from quantum 
mechanical effects, hold great promise for many applica-
tions, including quantum computing, electronics, energy 
storage, etc., which is discussed in detail in Sect. 3. How-
ever, after reviewing the literature, they also come with 
several challenges that researchers are actively address-
ing in synthesizing and scaling high-quality quantum 
materials presents challenges in achieving consistency 
and large-scale production and compatibility issues with 
devices and sensors applications. Many QMs are sensi-
tive to environmental factors during synthesis, neces-
sitating the development of reliable methods for mass 
production to make them practical for real-world appli-
cations. So, characterization and imaging techniques 
are crucial to understanding the complex behaviours of 
QMs. This includes studying the emergence of new elec-
tronic phases and investigating the impact of defects in 
these materials. Quantum machines can be highly sensi-
tive to external conditions such as temperature, pressure, 
and humidity, affecting their stability and performance. 
Ensuring the stability of these systems under various 
conditions is essential for practical use, driving research-
ers to develop encapsulation and protection strategies 
against environmental impacts. Integrating QMs into 
functional devices, like transistors or sensors, poses sig-
nificant challenges due to interface issues and compat-
ibility with existing technology. Achieving successful 
integration is vital to leverage the unique properties of 
quantum mechanics effectively. Quantum control and 
manipulation are essential for applications in quantum 
information processing and computing. However, precise 
control of quantum states within these materials is hin-
dered by challenges such as coherence time, noise, and 
error correction. Moreover, scaling up quantum systems 
to a practical level with many qubits remains a substan-
tial hurdle in quantum computing. Addressing issues 
related to quantum decoherence and error correction is 
crucial for unlocking the potential of quantum comput-
ers. Ethical and safety concerns must also be addressed as 
quantum materials and technologies advance, including 
encryption vulnerabilities and societal impacts, neces-
sitating regulatory considerations. Bridging the gap 
between fundamental research and commercialization 
is crucial, requiring collaboration between academia 
and industry. Standardization of synthesis, characteriza-
tion, and evaluation processes is essential for consistency 
and reproducibility in research and development, ensur-
ing the advancement of quantum materials for practical 
applications.
QMs offer vast potential across various applications, 
particularly in revolutionizing computing, communica-
tion, energy generation, and materials science. In com-
puting, QMs serve as qubits in quantum computers, 
capable of exponentially faster calculations than classi-
cal computers, and their inherent quantum properties 
make them ideal for quantum information processing. 
Additionally, QMs contribute to ultra-sensitive sensors 
and imaging devices, finding applications in medical 
diagnostics, mineral exploration, and national security. 
Moreover, QMs’ unique electronic and thermal proper-
ties offer avenues for more efficient energy generation 
and storage systems, including advanced photovoltaics, 
thermoelectric generators, and supercapacitors. They 
are crucial for developing secure quantum communica-
tion systems, such as quantum cryptography and key dis-
tribution protocols, and offer revolutionary potential in 
electronics, enabling ultra-fast, low-energy-consumption 
devices and superconductors with high transition tem-
peratures, promising to transform power grids and trans-
portation systems. Advancements in QMs will continue 
to drive progress in quantum computing, with a focus on 
stable and scalable qubits and integrating quantum error 
correction protocols to counter decoherence effects. 
Machine learning offers promising prospects in predict-
ing and understanding the behaviour of QMs, enhancing 
the discovery of novel materials with exceptional prop-
erties. Collaborations within the scientific community 
are essential for advancing knowledge and applications 
of QMs. Additionally, exploring exotic phenomena in 
van der Waals QMs holds promise for fundamental sci-
ence and technological advancements, with potential 
applications in electronic devices, quantum computing, 
and optoelectronics. Similarly, exploring new physics 
in interacting quantum many-body systems can lead to 
breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulations, and 
understanding exotic states of matter like topological 
insulators and quantum Hall systems. Developing hybrid 
systems combining QMs with established technologies 
and specialized measurement techniques can further 
enhance QM applications while deepening our under-
standing of quantum physics. In Fig. 7, we demonstrated 
a pictorial representation of challenges in QMs research 
and possible solutions in long- and short-terms.
