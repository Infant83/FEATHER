This review investigates the reciprocal relationship in which AI addresses foundational challenges in quantum computing, while quantum computing offers the potential to advance machine learning beyond classical constraints. Recent advancements exemplify this interaction: Google DeepMind’s AlphaQubit neural network decoder has achieved state-of-the-art quantum error correction, improving performance by 6% over tensor networks and 30% over correlated matching methods. Additionally, quantum neural networks have demonstrated exponential improvements in sample complexity for specific learning tasks. This review systematically examines the current landscape of quantum-AI integration across three primary dimensions. First, it addresses AI-enhanced quantum systems, such as transformer-based error correction, reinforcement learning for circuit optimization, and AI-driven hardware calibration. Second, it explores quantum-accelerated machine learning algorithms, including variational quantum neural networks, quantum generative adversarial networks, and quantum reinforcement learning. Third, it evaluates industry deployments in sectors such as life sciences, financial services, climate modeling, and pharmaceutical development. Notable examples include IonQ’s quantum chemistry simulations, which achieved 40% efficiency improvements in carbon capture material design; St. Jude’s identification of KRAS protein inhibitors using quantum machine learning with experimental validation; and JP Morgan Chase’s implementation of quantum portfolio optimization. The analysis indicates that the field has advanced from preliminary demonstrations to production-grade applications, especially in drug discovery and molecular simulation, where quantum computing offers measurable benefits. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, including barren plateaus in variational algorithms, scalability constraints in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, requirements for real-time decoding speed, and the necessity for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) systems. IBM’s 2029 roadmap, which targets 200 logical qubits capable of executing 100 million gates, together with progress in high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes, outlines a trajectory toward practical fault tolerance. This review makes two principal research contributions: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Quantum Advantage Assessment: We establish the first systematic, integrated methodology for determining quantum computing feasibility that combines problem characterization, resource estimation, quantum advantage assessment, and quantum algorithm paradigm selection. This framework consolidates criteria scattered across academic literature and industry practice into a unified decision-making tool applicable across chemistry, optimization, machine learning, and simulation domains. The framework addresses a critical industry need: enabling non-expert practitioners (chemists, financial analysts, materials scientists) to objectively assess quantum computing suitability without requiring deep quantum expertise. Novel Quantum Resource Optimization Algorithms: We present three concrete algorithmic contributions advancing quantum-AI integration: • Data Encoding Efficiency Algorithm that automatically selects optimal qubit encoding strategies (amplitude vs. angle encoding) minimizing total quantum resource consumption • Error Budget Optimization Algorithm that iteratively determines optimal quantum error correction code distance balancing logical error rate targets against physical qubit overhead • Real-time Hardware Specification Aggregation from multiple quantum cloud platforms (IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Google, IonQ) enabling dynamic feasibility assessment as hardware capabilities evolve Combined, these contributions establish quantum computing advantage assessment as a rigorous, data-driven discipline rather than ad-hoc expert judgment. The framework enables strategic quantum computing investment decisions, accelerates problem identification for early quantum utility, and provides a reference methodology for standardizing quantum advantage evaluation across academia and industry. This review synthesizes insights from recent academic literature, industry implementations, and expert perspectives to deliver a comprehensive assessment of quantum-AI synergies grounded in this evaluation framework. The mathematical foundations, ranging from quantum Fourier transforms to Gaussian processes, are examined. Best practices for researchers and practitioners are also outlined. The findings suggest that, although universal quantum advantage has not yet been realized, domain-specific quantum-AI applications in chemistry, optimization, and sensing are achieving practical utility in 2024-2025.

Currently, infrared detector technology is in its third generation and faces enormous challenges.

Infrared detectors for thermal imaging have many uses in industrial applications, security, search and rescue, surveillance, medical, research, meteorology, climatology, and astronomy. Presently, high-performance infrared imaging technology mostly relies on epitaxially grown structures of the small-bandgap bulk alloy mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT), indium antimonide (InSb), and GaAs-based quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs), contingent upon the application and wavelength range.

Conventional static façades, which are unable to adapt to dynamic external conditions, often compromise energy efficiency and occupant comfort. In contrast, adaptive façades present a groundbreaking opportunity to transform building design by responding dynamically to environmental stimuli, optimizing energy consumption, and enhancing indoor conditions. This paper explores the recent advancements in adaptive façade systems, emphasizing their potential to improve thermal comfort, daylight performance, and most essential the energy efficiency. In addition, this paper highlights the transformative role of quantum energy and smart materials in advancing façade performance and sustainable design. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of using adaptive façades to transform sustainable building practices, offering architects, researchers, and designers a roadmap for integrating innovative and energy-efficient solutions into the built environment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.55214/25768484.v9i1.4251", "journal": "Edelweiss Applied Science and Technology", "cited_by_count": 8, "pdf_url": "https://learning-gate.com/index.php/2576-8484/article/download/4251/1648", "pdf_urls": ["https://learning-gate.com/index.php/2576-8484/article/download/4251/1648"], "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.55214/25768484.v9i1.4251", "is_oa": true, "oa_status": "diamond", "downloaded_pdf_url": "https://learning-gate.com/index.php/2576-8484/article/download/4251/1648"}}
