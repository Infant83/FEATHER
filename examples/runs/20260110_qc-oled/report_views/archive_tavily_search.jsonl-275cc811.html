          &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Scientists at Mitsubishi Chemical, a member of the IBM Quantum Innovation Center at Keio University in Japan, worked with our team on new approaches to error mitigation and novel quantum algorithms to address these very challenges. In the new arXiv pre-print, “Applications of Quantum Computing for Investigations of Electronic Transitions in Phenylsulfonyl-carbazole TADF Emitters,” we — along with collaborators at Keio University and JSR — describe quantum computations of the “excited states,” or high energy states, of industrial chemical compounds that could potentially be used in the fabrication of efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. [...] 3 minute read\n\n# Unlocking the potential of today’s noisy quantum computers for OLED applications\n\nQuantum computers could be invaluable tools for studying the electronic structure and dynamical properties of complex molecules and materials. After all, it makes more sense to model quantum mechanical systems on a quantum device than on a classical computer. However, as we work our way towards building quantum computers with quantum circuits to surpass the capabilities of classical computers, we face several challenges. These include the need to greatly diminish noise that introduces errors and disrupts qubit function, and to get the most out of the limited number of qubits available on existing quantum hardware. [...] OLEDs have become increasingly popular in recent years as the basis for fabrication of thin, flexible TV and mobile phone displays that emit light upon application of an electric current. Our study involved examining electronic transitions of high energy states in phenylsulfonyl-carbazole (PSPCz) molecules, which could be useful thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for OLED technology. TADF emitters could potentially produce OLEDs that perform with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency, compared with conventional fluorophores currently used to make OLEDs whose quantum efficiencies are limited to 25 percent. That large boost in efficiency means manufacturers could produce OLEDs for use in devices requiring low-power consumption, such as cell phones.&quot;,

          &quot;content&quot;: &quot;on Quantum Computers,” a joint project from IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University, has been published in “npj Computational Materials,” a world-renowned Nature Research Journal. Scientist at Mitsubishi Chemical and IBM initiated a joint research project with collaborators at JSR and Keio University to calculate the excited states of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which are applied to the fabrication of efficient OLEDs. The parties have developed a new scheme to mitigate the error from current noisy quantum computers and succeeded in improving the calculation accuracy. This is the world-first research case of applying quantum computers to excited states calculations of commercial materials. We expect the proposed error mitigation scheme, together with the [...] the proposed error mitigation scheme, together with the improvements of the performance of quantum computers will provide ever more accurate quantum chemistry calculation results for designing OLED emitters with high quantum efficiency in the near term. We continue research in the area of using quantum computers to accelerate the development of a wide range of new materials. About the IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University Opened in May 2018 by Keio University and IBM Japan on the Yagami Campus of the university’s Faculty of Science and Technology, the IBM Quantum Network Hub at Keio University brings together academia and industry, with Mitsubishi Chemical and JSR as founding members. It is also the first IBM Quantum Hub in Asia leveraging IBM Quantum Systems, the most advanced [...] calculations with the use of quantum computers have been proposed. These algorithms are expected to be useful to perform calculations of large systems that have not been possible on classical computers. On the other hand, most benchmark calculation for the validation of these algorithms in the literature were only applied to simple molecular systems such as H2, LiH and for the complicated chemical systems few surveys of the ability of these algorithms has been carried out. Moreover, due to the error in quantum computer, it is difficult to achieve chemical accuracy for the calculations on current device. The goal of the work is to use two quantum algorithms (qEOM-VQE and VQD algorithms) to reliably predict excited states energies of TADF materials which is used as a kind of OLED emitters.&quot;,
