1  Introduction
Electrospinning method is currently at the forefront of 
research [1–4] and industrialization of fiber-based polymer 
materials due to its attractive properties such as the huge 
length-to-diameter ratio, the ability to produce smooth 
nanofibers, and the ease of manipulating the composition 
and properties of the fibers being formed.
Compared with other methods of manufacturing 
nanoscale fibers (e.g. drawing, coating, printing [5]) ES is a 
fairly automated, versatile, and affordable method, that has 
been constantly developing. Although the concept of elec­
trospinning was developed back in the sixteenth century, its 
practical application has become widespread only in the last 
two decades. This innovative method has found wide appli­
cation in various fields, including tissue engineering [6], 
sensor technology [7], drug delivery systems [8], fluores­
cent semiconductor development [9], biotechnology [10], 
filtration processes [11] and many other fields (Fig. 1 left). 
Depending on the type of their laying, electrospun fibers can 
be used to form membranes that will be characterized by 
good flexibility and mechanical strength, porosity, as well as 
hydrophobic and catalytic properties [12]. The introduction 
of various additives into polymer matrices helps to increase 
thermostability, fiber formation capacity, and luminescence 
capability. The inclusion of inorganic compounds (e.g., 
metal ions [13]), organic dyes (e.g., fluorescent dyes [14]) 
or π-conjugated polymers [15] can purposefully change both 
physical and chemical properties. OL’s, being semiconduc­
tors, serve as promising additives for research involving 
electrospun fibers, showing considerable potential and wide 
application in various fields [16–18].

This review focuses on electrospinning as the primary 
technique for creating polymer nanofibers with unique char­
acteristics. Compared to other methods, electrospinning is 
highly adaptable, cost-efficient, and widely adopted, with 
the added benefit of being automated. Through the addition 
of various modifiers, properties of electrospun fibers can 
be tailored, making them particularly suitable for applica­
tions involving organoluminophores (OLs) across scien­
tific and industrial domains. In this article, we explore the 
use of electrospinning specifically for incorporating OLs 
into fibrous structures. OLs offer high luminescence and a 
broad spectral range, positioning them as valuable compo­
nents in functional light-emitting materials. Electrospinning 
allows for the uniform embedding of organic luminescent 
molecules in nanofibers, enhancing brightness stability. 
Furthermore, the flexibility of this method in shaping mate­
rial morphology and tuning optical properties broadens the 
potential applications of OLs in fields such as sensor devel­
opment, biomedical imaging, and flexible electronics.
Nanoparticles (NPs) are valuable tools in biochemistry, 
pharmacy, and biomedical sciences. Their small size allows 
unique characteristics to emerge, vastly different from bulk 
materials. Like electrospun fibers, characterized by a high 
surface-to-volume ratio and unique chemical properties, 
NPs find applications in biomedical fields like drug deliv­
ery, imaging, and diagnostics [19–21]. The development of 
organic dye nanoparticles makes a major breakthrough in 
fluorescence research. Organic dyes exhibit fluorescence 
through two mechanisms: resonant transitions and charge-
transfer (CT) transitions. Resonant dyes, such as fluores­
ceins and rhodamines, are characterized by well-defined, 
narrow absorption and emission spectra with small Stokes 
shifts. On the other hand, solvent polarity has a significant 
impact on the bigger Stokes shifts and wider, structure­
less bands displayed by CT dyes such as coumarins. Early 
attempts to produce organic dye nanoparticles encoun­
tered difficulties because of their limited thermal stability 
and mechanical strength relative to inorganic materials. A 
breakthrough came in the 1990s when Nakanishi and col­
laborators introduced the “reprecipitation method,” facili­
tating the systematic synthesis of organic dye nanoparticles. 
This innovation led to the discovery of size-dependent pho­
tophysical properties, including fluorescence, in various 
organic systems. Subsequent research has expanded these 
methodologies, introducing a wide array of organic dyes and 
fabrication strategies, thereby enhancing the versatility and 
application potential of fluorescent organic nanoparticles 
[22–24]. Nowadays, there’s increasing interest in enhanc­
ing nanoparticles for bioimaging, biosensing, optics, and 
more[25]. This review focuses on FONs, i.e., fluorescent 
organic nanoparticles, which are versatile nanostructures 
emitting light across spectra, offering diverse applications 
in biology and medicine, with potential for combined diag­
nostics and therapy (Fig. 1 right) [25, 26].
FONs propose several significant advantages over other 
materials. One of many is their better stability, biocompat­
ibility and better light scattering effect. Additionally, com­
pared to nanoparticles made from metals and inorganic 
compounds, organic nanoparticles are cheaper, can be pre­
pared in a simple way and have a high possibility of modifi­
cation by inserting other functional groups [25, 27].
Luminescent nanoparticles from conjugated polymers 
address processing challenges, especially in multilayer 
devices [28] Synthesizing them via dispersed system polym­
erization offers advantages like access to stable materials 
for tasks such as cell imaging and creating nanocomposites. 
These nanoparticles are recognized for their potential in cell 
imaging. Despite their wide use in organic light-emitting 
diodes (OLEDs) and color conversion layers (CCLs), fluo­
rescent and phosphorescent compounds are not extensively 
researched, highlighting the importance of further analysis 
[26].
In our review, we aim to thoroughly examine the 
strengths and weaknesses of both methods concerning their 
effectiveness in organic fluorophore technology. By ana­
lyzing aspects such as manufacturing complexity, compat­
ibility with semiconductors and other materials, as well as 
the enhancement of optical properties, we can determine 
their suitability for specific applications. Additionally, we 
will explore the latest trends, achievements, challenges, and 
prospects in this area, providing insights into the evolving 
industry of organic semiconductor technologies.
1.1  Background
Electrospinning, originally termed electrostatic spinning, 
has its conceptual roots in the sixteenth century, when the 
Royal College of Physicians observed the formation of 
a cone and ejection of droplets from a water drop near a 
charged piece of amber—a precursor to the modern Taylor 
cone. It wasn’t until the early twentieth century that electros­
pinning was formally recognized for its potential to produce 
fibers, leading to its first patent [29]. Since then, the technol­
ogy has evolved significantly, with rapid advancements over 
the past few decades transforming it into a highly versatile 
method for fabricating nanofibers with intricate structures. 
These developments have not only refined the technique 
but also expanded its applications, fostering innovations in 
fields ranging from materials science to biomedicine [30].
Electrospinning is a technique for micro- and nano-
scale fiber fabrication from polymer solutions. Using an 
appropriate voltage applied to the steel needle and adjust­
ing the process parameters, morphologically different types 
of fibers can be produced. In modern times, a vast array of

peptide-based nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, quantum 
dots, polymer-based nanoparticles, inorganic vectors, lipid-
based nanoparticles, hybrid NPs, and metal nanoparticles. 
Nanoparticles are a new and growing area of research fields 
like delivering medicine, studying tiny fluids, making sen­
sors, analyzing tiny samples, and engineering tissues for 
treating diseases better [32–35]. Fluorescent organic nano-
dots are one branch of nanoparticle development.
Despite the existence of many methods of producing 
nanoparticles, the most successful and simple approaches 
are solvent evaporation, emulsification or nanoprecipita­
tion [26]. There are various approaches to acquiring FONs, 
depending on the preferred structure and intended use. 
Numerous methods exist for obtaining nanoparticles, but 
not many consist of fluorophores.
FONs can be created through the precipitation of the fluo­
rophore solution upon mixing with water. The incorporation 
of a surfactant enables micelles to encapsulate the fluoro­
phore particles during precipitation, facilitated by the inter­
action between the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant and 
the nonpolar fluorophore molecules (Fig. 2). Surfactant is 
intended to minimize the surface energy of small particles. 
In the absence of surfactant, surface energy is minimized 
during the formation of large fluorophore particles. There 
are different methods of creating FONs, some are very sim­
ple, while others are more demanding.
Emulsions are solutions of immiscible liquids, catego­
rized by their size into micro-emulsions (10– 100 nm), mini-
emulsions (100 nm– 1 µm), and macro-emulsions (&gt; 1 µm). 
Nano-emulsions fall between micro- and mini-emulsions 
and can be created using low or high energy methods. Low 
energy emulsification relies on spontaneous processes, 
electrospinning machine variations has been developed, 
ranging from needleless to ultrasound-enhanced designs. 
Nevertheless, all these systems operate on a similar funda­
mental principle. Figure 2 (left) illustrates a basic electros­
pinning setup, consisting of a syringe pump (A) that ensures 
a constant flow of solution through a steel needle (B). High 
voltage (C) generates electrostatic forces that pull the solu­
tion into a Taylor cone, ejecting fine fibers that deposit on a 
collector (D). The formation of fibers depends on solution’s 
parameters such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface ten­
sion. The needle size influences fiber diameter, while flow 
rate must be carefully regulated to avoid droplet formation 
or jet interruption. The collector type also plays a critical 
role: a flat, stationary collector produces randomly oriented 
fibers, while rotating or patterned collectors can align or 
structure the fibers. Optimizing these factors is crucial, as 
each adjustment impacts the morphology, diameter, and uni­
formity of the electrospun fibers.
The first use of nanoparticles dates to the fourth century 
AD. A cup found from that time, made of special glass con­
taining gold and silver nanoparticles with the addition of 
copper, emitted a different glow at a certain angle [31].
The use of nanoparticles in scientific research has pro­
gressed significantly over the years, with studies dem­
onstrating their wide-ranging applications and potential 
benefits. The connection between nanoparticles and biomed­
icine was established in the late 1970s, and by 2005, nearly 
thirty papers referred to this topic. Within a decade, Web of 
Science published over 1000 articles on nanomedicine in 
2015, with a majority focusing on nanoparticles (NPs) for 
biomedical applications. Advanced forms of nanoparticles 
(NPs) include nanocarriers such as dendrimers, liposomes,

advancements in the field of nanotechnology and its envi­
ronmental applications.
In the study conducted in 2023 [37], the integration of 
a copper-based complex into a poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) matrix demonstrates the potential of electrospin­
ning to create hybrid organic–inorganic nanofibers with 
tailored photoluminescent properties. A tetrakis((μ3-N-

was 
synthesized and incorporated into PMMA via electrospin­
ning to form Cu@PMMA nanofibers with diameters rang­
