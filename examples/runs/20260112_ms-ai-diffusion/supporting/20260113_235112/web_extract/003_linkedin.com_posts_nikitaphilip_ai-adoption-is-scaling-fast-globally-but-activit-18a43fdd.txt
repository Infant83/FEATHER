AI adoption is scaling fast globally, but the gap is widening. I just read Microsoft’s Global AI Adoption 2025 report, and the data is striking. 1 in 6 people worldwide now use generative AI, but adoption is unfolding very differently across regions. Here are 3 insights that stood out to me: 🌍 A growing adoption divide: Use of generative AI is increasing nearly twice as fast in the Global North as in the Global South. Today, 24.7% of the working-age population in the Global North uses these tools, compared to 14.1% in the Global South. 📈 Sustained investment drives outcomes: UAE ranks # 1 globally with 64% of its working-age population using generative AI. This reflects years of deliberate investment in digital infrastructure, AI skills, and public-sector adoption. Having grown up in the UAE, it's compelling to see how long-term focus compounds into real scale. 🎯 Relevance accelerates adoption: South Korea’s rise was driven by a combination of improved Korean-language LLM capabilities, strong consumer-facing AI experiences, and a cultural inflection point when Ghibli-style image generation went viral. As you think about your organization or community, what matters most in driving real, sustained AI adoption: usability, relevance, or confidence in the tools?

The data is striking, but the diagnosis is often wrong. We keep calling this a 'Skills Gap' or an 'Adoption Gap.' In reality, it’s an Infrastructure Gap. We are measuring Ferrari adoption (GenAI) in places where we haven't finished building the roads (Data Infrastructure/DPI). If we want that 14.1% number to move in the Global South, we need to stop funding 'pilots' and start funding 'pipes.' The connectivity layer has to come first.

Successful AI adoption depends on accurate, well‑governed data and strong organisational knowledge. If either of these is lacking, the likelihood of failure increases significantly.

  As we enter 2026, this new analysis on Global AI Adoption in 2025 underscores just how quickly AI has moved from experimentation to true business transformation. What stands out most is the shift from potential to productivity. Organizations across every industry—and in every region—are no longer asking “Should we use AI?” but “How fast can we scale it responsibly?” At Microsoft, we continue to see three themes accelerating that momentum: 🔹 AI as an economic driver: Companies are reporting measurable impact—faster decision‑making, higher automation, and meaningful gains in employee productivity. 🔹 A new skills imperative: Workforce readiness is becoming the new competitive divide. The investments businesses make today in upskilling will define their trajectory for the next decade. 🔹 Responsible AI as a foundation for trust: Adoption isn’t just about capability; it's about governance, safety, and accountability at scale. The past year has validated something important: AI isn’t simply a technology shift, it’s an operational shift—and a cultural one. The organizations that embrace both will lead the next wave of innovation. A great read for anyone shaping their 2026 strategy. 👇

  Today, we are releasing our AI Economy Institute AI diffusion report. Global adoption of generative AI kept climbing in the second half of 2025, reaching 16.3% of the world’s population, up from 15.1% in the first half. In other words, roughly 1 in 6 people worldwide are now using genAI tools to learn, work, or solve problems. But the same data also shows a widening digital divide: AI usage among the working-age population is now 24.7% in the Global North vs. 14.1% in the Global South. A few notable signals from the rankings and market dynamics: UAE remains #1 at 64.0% working-age usage; Singapore follows at 60.9%. The U.S. leads in infrastructure and frontier development, yet sits at 28.3% working-age usage and ranked 24th in usage share. DeepSeek’s rapid rise is a reminder that diffusion is shaped as much by access and availability as by model quality, an open-source model and a free chatbot can remove barriers and scale quickly in markets underserved by traditional providers. If you’re working on AI strategy in 2026, this report is worth a read, especially for what it implies about infrastructure, skills, language, and public-sector adoption.
